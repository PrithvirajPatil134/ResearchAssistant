## Research Objective

**The objective of this research is to** investigate how internal IT governance mechanisms—specifically Digital Resource Orchestration (DRO) and software license rationalization—influence capital efficiency and firm performance in enterprises.

## Business Context

Modern tech enterprises systematically waste 20–50% of their SaaS budgets through "zombie seats"—unused licenses resulting from employee turnover and poor governance. This capital destruction remains largely invisible to boards and investors, yet represents a measurable drag on firm efficiency and returns. Understanding how operational discipline in digital resource management drives superior ROIC provides actionable insights for investors, CFOs, and boards seeking leading indicators of organizational effectiveness.

## Research Scope (Following "General to Specific" Structure)

I would like to find out:

1. **How** do firms differentiate between strategic slack (intentional scaling buffers) and operational waste (orphaned accounts)?

2. **To what extent** does SaaS rationalization discipline correlate with superior Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)?

3. **Why** do managers over-provision digital resources—is it risk aversion, lack of governance, or deliberate agility strategy?

4. **What** is the cost of rigidity when strict zero-waste policies potentially stifle operational agility?

## Suggested Title (Aligned with Objective)

**"Capital Efficiency in the Digital Era: The Impact of IT Governance and Resource Rationalization on Firm Performance in Technology Enterprises"**

## Objective Rationale (Prof. Cardasso Criteria)

| Criterion | How This Objective Meets It |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Starts with "The objective of this research is to..." | ✓ Opening statement |
| Avoids broad topics | ✓ Specific to DRO/SaaS in mid-market tech |
| Has business context | ✓ 20-50% waste, invisible to boards, ROIC impact |
| Title uses same/similar words as objective | ✓ "Capital Efficiency," "IT Governance," "Resource Rationalization" |
| Goes from General to Specific | ✓ IT governance → DRO → SaaS rationalization → ROIC |
| Clear "angle" for positioning | ✓ First to link tactical rationalization to financial performance |
