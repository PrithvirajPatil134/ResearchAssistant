> # Digital Resource Orchestration and Capital Efficiency in SaaS Management

## A Doctoral-Level Conceptual Explanation

Prof. Cardasso | Bordeaux Business School | DBA Research Guidance

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 1. Conceptual Definition

Digital Resource Orchestration (DRO) refers to the systematic governance, allocation, and optimization of digital assets—particularly SaaS subscriptions and cloud-based tools—to maximize capital efficiency within technology enterprises.

From the course materials, DRO is positioned as an internal governance mechanism that addresses a specific problem: modern tech enterprises systematically waste 20–50% of their SaaS budgets through "zombie seats"—unused licenses caused by employee turnover and poor governance. This capital destruction is largely invisible to boards and investors yet represents a measurable drag on firm efficiency and returns.

Capital efficiency in this context measures how effectively a firm converts its digital resource investments into productive output, typically assessed through metrics like Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

The thesis reference frames DRO not merely as cost-cutting, but as operational discipline—a leading indicator of managerial competence that investors, CFOs, and boards can use to evaluate firm health.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 2. Theoretical Foundation

The course materials identify several theoretical lenses for examining DRO:

### Agency Theory
Explores why managers over-provision digital resources. Two competing explanations emerge:
- **Risk aversion**: "Better to have it and not need it"
- **Governance gaps**: Lack of oversight mechanisms enabling waste

### Strategic Slack Theory
A critical distinction from the materials: not all unused capacity constitutes waste. The framework differentiates between:

| Category | Definition | Managerial Intent |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Strategic Slack | Intentional "scaling buffers"—paying for extra seats to ensure agility during growth spurts | Deliberate, value-creating |
| Operational Neglect | Orphaned accounts from turnover, genuine waste | Unintentional, value-destroying |

### IT Governance Literature
The materials note a critical gap: existing Software Asset Management (SAM) literature focuses on compliance, while IT governance literature focuses on strategy alignment. No existing research quantitatively links tactical asset rationalization to financial performance—this is the thesis's contribution.

### The Cost of Rigidity Framework
An important counterpoint: strict financial discipline (zero-waste policies) may inadvertently stifle operational agility or slow project scaling. This tension between efficiency and flexibility is central to the research design.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 3. Key Components

Based on the course materials, DRO comprises:

### 3.1 Governance Mechanisms
- License lifecycle management
- Automated deprovisioning upon employee departure
- Periodic usage audits and rationalization reviews

### 3.2 Measurement Constructs
- **Zombie seat ratio**: Percentage of paid licenses with no active usage
- **SaaS spend efficiency**: Productive output per dollar of subscription cost
- **ROIC impact**: Contribution of rationalization to overall capital returns

### 3.3 Behavioral Dimensions
The materials emphasize understanding managerial intent:
- Why do managers over-provision?
- What organizational factors enable waste accumulation?
- How do governance structures influence provisioning decisions?

### 3.4 Strategic Considerations
- Balancing efficiency against growth readiness
- Distinguishing intentional buffers from neglect
- Aligning IT governance with financial performance objectives

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 4. Practical Application

### For Practitioners (CFOs, IT Leaders, Boards)
DRO provides a framework for:
1. Visibility: Making invisible capital destruction measurable
2. Governance: Establishing oversight mechanisms for digital assets
3. Decision-making: Distinguishing strategic slack from waste
4. Performance indicators: Using rationalization metrics as leading indicators of operational discipline

### For Investors
The thesis positions DRO metrics as leading indicators of managerial competence—firms demonstrating strong digital resource governance may signal broader operational discipline.

### Implementation Considerations
The materials acknowledge practical tensions:
- Overly rigid policies may harm agility
- Measurement requires access to sensitive operational data
- Behavioral change requires understanding managerial motivations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 5. Research Considerations

### Methodological Approach
The course materials recommend a mixed-methods or qualitative-first approach given data sensitivity:

Primary Qualitative Data: Semi-structured interviews with 30–40 senior IT and Finance leaders under anonymity. This captures the strategic rationale (the "why") that quantitative data alone cannot reveal.

### Key Research Questions
From the materials, the core research question:
│ *How do internal governance mechanisms—specifically SaaS rationalization and digital resource orchestration—mitigate capital inefficiency, and to what extent does this operational discipline drive superior ROIC in mid-market technology firms?*

### Contribution to Literature
The thesis addresses a gap: bridging SAM (compliance-focused) and IT governance (strategy-focused) literatures by quantitatively linking tactical asset rationalization to financial performance.

### Methodological Challenges
- Quantitative data on "waste" is highly sensitive and protected
- Distinguishing strategic slack from waste requires qualitative insight
- Establishing causality between rationalization and ROIC requires careful research design

## Mapping to Your Thesis Proposal

| Proposal Section | DRO/Capital Efficiency Application |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Introduction | Frame the 20–50% waste problem; establish practical significance |
| Literature Review | Position at intersection of SAM, IT governance, and financial performance literatures |
| Theoretical Framework | Agency Theory + Strategic Slack + Cost of Rigidity |
| Methodology | Mixed-methods; qualitative interviews → quantitative validation |
| Expected Contribution | First quantitative link between tactical rationalization and ROIC |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## Summary

Digital Resource Orchestration represents a nascent but significant research domain at the intersection of IT governance, financial performance, and organizational behavior. Your thesis addresses a genuine gap by moving beyond compliance-focused SAM literature to establish quantitative links between operational discipline and capital efficiency. The mixed-methods approach acknowledges both the sensitivity of the data and the importance of understanding managerial intent behind provisioning decisions.
