## Thesis Title:
**Capital Efficiency in the Digital Era: The Impact of IT Governance and Resource Rationalization on Firm Performance in Technology Enterprises**

## Core Research Question:
How do internal governance mechanisms—specifically SaaS rationalization and digital resource orchestration—mitigate capital inefficiency, and to what extent does this operational discipline drive superior ROIC in mid-market technology firms?

## The Problem:
Modern tech enterprises systematically waste 20–50% of their SaaS budgets through "zombie seats" (unused licenses caused by employee turnover and poor governance). This capital destruction is largely invisible to boards and investors—yet represents a measurable drag on firm efficiency and returns.

## Why This Matters:
The research bridges a critical gap: while SAM (Software Asset Management) literature focuses on *compliance*, and IT governance literature focuses on *strategy alignment*, no research quantitatively links *tactical asset rationalization* to *financial performance*. This thesis fills that void—with practical implications for investors, CFOs, and boards seeking leading indicators of operational discipline.

## 1. Expanding the Research Scope (Addressing Points 1-4)

I will move beyond viewing "zombie seats" solely as waste and investigate the managerial intent behind them. I plan to incorporate these dimensions into my theoretical framework:

- **Strategic Slack vs. Waste:** Differentiating between intentional "scaling buffers" (*paying for extra seats to ensure agility during growth spurts*) and genuine "operational neglect" (*orphaned accounts from turnover*).

- **The Cost of Rigidity:** Investigating whether strict financial discipline (*zero-waste policies*) inadvertently stifles operational agility or slows down project scaling (*Point 4 in your response above*).

- **Behavioral Drivers:** Using Agency Theory to explore *why* managers over-provision—is it risk aversion (*"better to have it and not need it"*) or simply a lack of governance?

## 2. Addressing the Data Collection Challenge

You rightly identified that quantitative data on "waste" is highly sensitive and protected. To navigate this, I will adopt the mixed-methods or qualitative-first approach you recommended:

- **Primary Qualitative Data:** Conducting semi-structured interviews with 30-40 senior IT and Finance leaders under anonymity. This allows us to capture the *strategic rationale* (the "why") that quantitative data misses.

- **Indirect Quantitative Proxies:** Instead of asking for sensitive raw data, I can use survey instruments to ask for *ranges* or *ratios* (e.g., "perceived percentage of unused licenses") rather than exact dollar figures, which improves response rates. We can also utilize any publicly available data contextual to our topic to cater to quantitative needs of this research.

- **"Zombie Seat Hunter" Audit Data:** I can potentially use anonymized, aggregated data from my own consulting audits as a secondary dataset, strictly adhering to data controller guidelines.

This shifts the thesis from a simple "waste is bad" argument to a more nuanced exploration of "Strategic Resource Orchestration: Balancing Capital Efficiency with Operational Agility."
