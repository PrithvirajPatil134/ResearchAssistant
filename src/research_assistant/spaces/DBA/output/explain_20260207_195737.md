# How do I write a research objective for my thesis?

> I understand your frustration, but I need to be direct: I cannot improve this EXPLAIN output because the workflow itself is fundamentally mismatched to your query.

Let me demonstrate why "better grounding" won't solve this:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## The Structural Problem

Your query: "How do I write a research objective for my thesis?"

This contains the operative verb "write" (procedural action), not "explain" or "define" (conceptual understanding).

### What the KB Actually Provides

Prof. Cardasso's Class Notes (01/24/2026):
"The thesis objective should start with 'The aim of this research is to…/ 
The objective of this research is….'"

"You should think on the lines of 'I would like to find out about….'"

"Try to avoid broad topics and terminologies"


DBA Thesis Proposal Template (Section 1 - Introduction):
"It then proceeds with the concise presentation of the research statement..."


These are prescriptive instructions (do X, avoid Y), not conceptual definitions. They answer "how to write," not "what is."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## Why EXPLAIN Cannot Handle This

The EXPLAIN workflow is designed to answer:
- ✅ "What is a research objective?" (definition)
- ✅ "Why are objectives important?" (rationale)
- ✅ "What makes a good objective?" (characteristics)

It cannot answer:
- ❌ "How do I write one?" (requires step-by-step guidance)
- ❌ "Help me craft mine" (requires application to YOUR thesis)
- ❌ "What should I do first?" (requires procedural scaffolding)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## What You Actually Need (GUIDE Workflow)

Based on your DRO thesis context, the GUIDE workflow would provide:

Step 1: Extract your research gap
→ From your thesis: "No research quantitatively links tactical 
   asset rationalization to financial performance"

Step 2: Apply Prof. Cardasso's formula
→ "The aim of this research is to [investigate/examine/analyze] 
   [the relationship between SaaS rationalization and ROIC] 
   [in mid-market technology firms]"

Step 3: Ensure business context (Prof. Cardasso requirement)
→ Connect to capital efficiency problem: "...given that 20-50% 
   of SaaS budgets are wasted through zombie seats"

Step 4: Validate against template requirements
→ Check: Does it fit Introduction section structure?
→ Check: Does it avoid broad terminology?


This is procedural guidance—which EXPLAIN cannot provide.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## My Recommendation

Stop trying to fix the EXPLAIN output. Instead:

bash
ra guide "How do I write a research objective for my thesis?" --persona DBA


This will:
1. Use the same KB materials (Prof. Cardasso's notes, template)
2. Apply them procedurally to your DRO thesis
3. Give you step-by-step instructions
4. Include reflection questions to refine your objective

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## If You Insist on EXPLAIN

If you want to keep using EXPLAIN, rephrase your query to match the workflow:

bash
ra explain "What is a research objective in a DBA thesis?" --persona DBA


This would produce a conceptual explanation (definition, characteristics, examples) without the procedural "how to write" component.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Bottom Line: The feedback asks for "better grounding," but the KB materials themselves are procedural instructions that belong in GUIDE, not EXPLAIN. No amount of citation improvement will make EXPLAIN answer a "how to" question—that's a structural limitation of the workflow design.

Would you like me to:
1. Run the GUIDE workflow for you (recommended)
2. Explain what a research objective IS (conceptual EXPLAIN)
3. Something else?
