## 1. PROPOSED TITLE / WORKING TITLE

**"Survival or Transformation? An Ichalkaranji Powerloom Owner's Crisis Decision"**

**Alternative Title:**  
*"The Perfect Storm: A Small Textile Manufacturer's Strategic Dilemma Amid Trade Shocks, Cost Pressures, and Regulatory Mandates"*

---

## 2. ORGANIZATION / INDUSTRY CONTEXT

### **Organization:**
- **Name:** [To be confirmed with owner consent—can be anonymized]
- **Owner:** [Factory Owner Name]
- **Location:** Ichalkaranji, Kolhapur District, Maharashtra, India
- **Type:** Family-owned small-scale MSME textile manufacturer
- **Business:** Powerloom greige fabric production (20-50 looms)
- **Established:** [Year—per owner records]
- **Employees:** 30-50 workers
- **Annual Turnover:** [To be collected from owner]
- **Business Model:** Purchases yarn → Weaves greige fabric → Sells to exporters/processors (70% export-oriented)

### **Industry Context:**

**Ichalkaranji Textile Cluster:**
- India's largest greige fabric production hub (~$170M daily turnover)
- ~2,000 small-scale powerloom units producing 40% of India's powerloom fabric
- Highly export-dependent (60-70% of production goes to US, EU, Africa)
- Fragmented market with low barriers to entry and intense price competition

**Industry Crisis (2024-2025):**

| **External Shock** | **Impact on Small MSMEs** |
|---|---|
| **US 50% tariff (Aug 2024)** | Export orders cancelled; pricing collapsed; factories operating at 30-50% capacity |
| **Maharashtra electricity tariff hike (June 2025)** | Power costs rose ₹3.5-4/unit; margins compressed to near-zero or negative |
| **MPCB pollution mandates (2024-2025)** | ~150 sizing units threatened with closure; bio-digester compliance costs ₹15-25 lakh per unit |
| **Bangladesh/Vietnam competition** | Lower-cost competitors with better infrastructure and trade agreements gaining market share |

**Result:** Mass layoffs, factory closures accelerating, 30,000-50,000 jobs at risk in Ichalkaranji alone.

## 3. KEY ISSUE / DECISION DILEMMA

**(What central question or challenge does the protagonist face?)**

**Central Dilemma:**

By late 2025, the factory owner faces an existential decision: **How to respond to a "perfect storm" of simultaneous crises (US tariff shock + electricity cost hike + pollution compliance mandates) when the traditional export-focused business model is structurally uncompetitive, yet transformation requires capital and capabilities the MSME lacks?**

**Specific Decision:**

The owner must choose among **four strategic options**, each with painful trade-offs and uncertain outcomes:

1. **Modernize** (₹50-75 lakh investment in shuttle-less looms, automation, bio-digesters, solar power)
   - *Pros:* 20-30% cost reduction; regulatory compliance; competitive advantage if tariff is temporary
   - *Cons:* High debt burden; uncertain ROI; export demand may not recover
   - *Sustainability Q:* Can the MSME service debt while operating at 30-50% capacity?

2. **Relocate** to Karnataka (₹30-40 lakh relocation cost for lower electricity tariffs)
   - *Pros:* ₹3.5-4/unit cost savings; state govt incentives; escape Maharashtra's MPCB restrictions
   - *Cons:* Loss of local supplier networks; labor shortages; social/family ties to Ichalkaranji severed
   - *Sustainability Q:* Will relocation savings offset disruption costs and stranded assets?

3. **Pivot to Domestic Market** (₹40-60 lakh investment in processed/branded fabric for Indian consumers)
   - *Pros:* 2-3x higher margins; insulated from US tariff; growing domestic demand (8-10% annually)
   - *Cons:* Requires design/marketing capabilities MSMEs lack; longer payment cycles; competition from large organized players
   - *Sustainability Q:* Can the owner build brand/distribution expertise in 18-24 months with depleted cash reserves?

4. **Exit the Business** (liquidate looms, close factory, redirect capital elsewhere)
   - *Pros:* Avoid further losses; salvage remaining capital
   - *Cons:* Loss of family legacy; 30-50 workers unemployed; loom resale value depressed (₹1-2 lakh vs. ₹4-5 lakh pre-crisis); limited alternative livelihoods in Ichalkaranji
   - *Sustainability Q:* What viable income sources exist post-exit for owner and workers in a textile-dependent region?

**Why This Is a Dilemma:**
- No option is obviously "correct"—each involves high risk, significant capital, and uncertain outcomes
- Financial analysis alone is insufficient; must weigh family legacy, worker welfare, and community impact
- External environment (trade policy, energy costs, regulations) is beyond owner's control, yet shapes every option's viability
- Decision must be made **now** (late 2025) as cash reserves deplete and creditors pressure for repayment

## 4. BACKGROUND SUMMARY (MAX 100 WORDS)

[Factory Name], a family-owned powerloom unit in Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra, faced a "perfect storm" in 2024-2025. A US 50% tariff (August 2024) devastated export demand; a Maharashtra electricity tariff hike (June 2025) compressed margins; and pollution board mandates threatened closure unless costly compliance investments were made. By late 2025, the factory was operating at 30-50% capacity, facing mounting debt, and struggling to retain workers. The owner had four strategic options: modernize with borrowed capital, relocate to a lower-cost state, pivot to the domestic market (requiring new capabilities), or exit the business entirely. Each path involved painful trade-offs and uncertain outcomes.

## 5. WHAT MAKES IT TEACHABLE?

**Management Areas & Frameworks:**

| **Domain** | **Frameworks** | **Classroom Application** |
|---|---|---|
| **Strategy** | Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, VRIO, Blue Ocean | Analyze competitive position pre- vs. post-tariff; assess strategic repositioning options |
| **Operations** | Capacity planning, break-even analysis, cost structure | Calculate cost per unit with/without modernization; evaluate relocation savings |
| **Finance** | NPV, payback period, debt capacity, financial sustainability | Build financial models for each option; determine affordable debt levels |
| **Family Business & OB** | Succession planning, stakeholder management, personal vs. business logic | Debate whether family legacy/worker welfare should override financial analysis |
| **Innovation** | Frugal innovation, lean transformation, organizational change | Design "lean" modernization or market-pivot strategy that minimizes capital/risk |
| **Sustainability** | Pollution compliance, ESG, circular economy | Evaluate compliance as strategic investment vs. cost burden |
| **Global Trade** | Tariff impact, supply chain diversification, market concentration risk | Assess export-reliance risk; compare India vs. Bangladesh/Vietnam trade environment |

**Why Students Will Engage:**
- **Real stakes:** Owner's livelihood, 30-50 workers' jobs, family legacy—not abstract business problems
- **Relatable "David vs. Goliath" narrative:** Small MSME facing global forces (tariffs, competition, regulations)
- **Multiple valid perspectives:** No predetermined "correct answer"—students must defend their choice against alternatives
- **Global relevance:** Trade wars, tariffs, sustainability mandates affect MSMEs worldwide—lessons apply beyond India
- **Actionable tools:** Students apply NPV, Five Forces, break-even analysis to evaluate real-world options

## 8. TENTATIVE LEARNING OBJECTIVES (2-3 POINTS)

**By engaging with this case, students will be able to:**

1. **Analyze competitive position and strategic options under external disruption**
   - Assess how external shocks (tariffs, cost increases, regulations) fundamentally alter a firm's competitive advantage
   - Evaluate four strategic paths (modernize, relocate, pivot, exit) using frameworks (Five Forces, SWOT, VRIO)
   - Identify which options are feasible given resource constraints (capital, capabilities, time)
   - *Application:* Recommend a strategic path, justify against alternatives, and address trade-offs/risks

2. **Conduct financial and operational analysis of strategic alternatives**
   - Analyze cost structures (fixed vs. variable, pre- vs. post-tariff)
   - Calculate break-even points, ROI, and debt sustainability for modernization/relocation/pivot options
   - Assess financial viability given cash flow constraints and uncertain market conditions
   - *Application:* Build financial models (NPV, payback period) to evaluate each option's sustainability

3. **Develop integrated business recommendations balancing multiple stakeholder interests**
   - Recognize competing stakeholder interests (owner/family, workers, creditors, community)
   - Weigh quantitative factors (financial analysis) vs. qualitative factors (family legacy, worker welfare, social impact)
   - Consider long-term sustainability vs. short-term survival imperatives
   - *Application:* Propose a phased implementation strategy (immediate survival tactics + medium-term restructuring + long-term transformation) that balances all stakeholder interests

## 10. NOTES / FACULTY COMMENTS

### **Why This Case Addresses Prof. Kakoli's Concerns:**

**✅ "Clear organizational challenge"**
- Tesla was a **public company governance** issue affecting entire industry
- Ichalkaranji is a **specific MSME crisis** with a named protagonist (factory owner) facing a concrete decision by late 2025

**✅ "Dilemma among possible options"**
- Four distinct strategic paths (modernize, relocate, pivot, exit) with no obvious "correct answer"
- Each option has legitimate pros/cons and involves painful trade-offs
- Students must defend their choice using financial analysis, strategic frameworks, and stakeholder considerations

**✅ "Company with protagonist and relevant data"**
- Protagonist: Named factory owner with decision authority, personal stakes (family legacy, worker welfare, financial survival)
- Data: Owner's financial/operational records + public industry/govt data (similar to Vinder Oils model)
- Consent assured: Owner willing to participate; written consent to be obtained

**✅ "Relevant (< 5 years); publishers decide what is relevant"**
- Crisis is **live and unresolved** (2024-2026): US tariff (Aug 2024), power tariff hike (June 2025), pollution mandates (2024-2025)
- Highly relevant to global challenges: trade wars, MSME survival, sustainability transitions, cost inflation
- Comparable to published cases on MSME crises (e.g., Vinder Oils on pricing dilemma, small manufacturers facing competition)

**✅ "Answers the 5 W's (why, what, where, when, whom)"**

| **5 W's** | **Ichalkaranji Case** |
|---|---|
| **WHO** | [Factory Owner Name], owner of [Factory Name], small powerloom MSME |
| **WHAT** | Strategic decision: modernize vs. relocate vs. pivot vs. exit amid "perfect storm" of crises |
| **WHERE** | Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra (India's largest greige fabric hub) |
| **WHEN** | Late 2025 (decision point after US tariff, power hike, pollution mandates converge) |
| **WHY** | Existential stakes: factory survival, worker livelihoods, family legacy, financial viability |

**✅ "Focus on dilemma, not solution; are solutions sustainable?"**
- Case **does not reveal** what the owner ultimately decided (if decision even made yet)
- Case ends with four options analyzed—students must debate which is sustainable
- Teaching note will guide instructors to ask: "Are the solutions sustainable?"
  - Can modernization ROI be achieved if export demand doesn't recover?
  - Can relocation savings offset disruption and stranded assets?
  - Can MSME build domestic market capabilities in time?
  - Is exiting viable when alternative livelihoods are scarce?

### **Advantages Over Tesla Case:**

| **Criterion** | **Tesla Governance** | **Ichalkaranji Textile** |
|---|---|---|
| **Consent** | ❌ Difficult (public company, legal sensitivity) | ✅ **Assured** (owner willing, written consent) |
| **Data Access** | ✅ Court docs, SEC filings, news | ✅ **Owner records + public data** |
| **Publication Risk** | ⚠️ Tesla/Musk legally sensitive | ✅ **Low** (small MSME, anonymizable) |
| **Relevance** | ✅ Dec 2025 court ruling | ✅ **Live crisis** (2024-2026) |
| **Student Engagement** | ✅ High (Elon Musk, governance scandals) | ✅ **High** (relatable MSME struggle, global trade/sustainability relevance) |
| **Teachability** | ✅ Governance, compensation, leadership | ✅ **Broader** (strategy, operations, finance, OB, innovation, sustainability, trade) |
| **Timeline to Publication** | ⚠️ Longer (legal review) | ✅ **Faster** (fewer approval gates) |

### **Potential Concerns & Mitigation:**

**Concern 1:** "Is a small MSME compelling enough for students compared to Tesla?"
- **Mitigation:** MSMEs employ 110M+ people in India, 60-70% of manufacturing employment globally. Their survival is economically/socially critical. Students relate to "David vs. Goliath" narratives. Published MSME cases (Vinder Oils) have strong classroom traction.

**Concern 2:** "Will students have enough data to analyze?"
- **Mitigation:** Owner's financial records + extensive public data (govt reports, trade stats, news coverage) provide rich analytical material. Exhibits (cost comparisons, option analysis, financial models) will be data-dense.

**Concern 3:** "Is this India-specific or globally relevant?"
- **Mitigation:** Trade shocks (tariffs, protectionism), cost inflation (energy, labor), and sustainability mandates (pollution compliance) affect MSMEs globally. Bangladesh, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, Eastern Europe face similar pressures. Case lessons generalize.

### **Next Steps (Upon Approval):**

1. **Draft consent agreement** for factory owner signature
2. **Schedule owner interview** (in-person preferred, virtual acceptable)
3. **Collect primary data:** financial records, operational stats, strategic views
4. **Compile secondary data:** govt reports, news articles, trade data
5. **Draft case narrative** (3-5 pages) + 7 exhibits
6. **Write teaching note** (learning objectives, discussion questions, instructor guide)
7. **Submit to Prof. Kakoli** for review before publisher submission

**Estimated Timeline:** 8-9 weeks from owner consent to publication-ready case
