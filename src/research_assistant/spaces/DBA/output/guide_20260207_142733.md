# Email Response Guidance: Prof. Cardasso's Terminology Feedback

Grounded in: Prof. Cardasso's Email (Feb 1, 2026) + DBA Research Proposal Template (Section 1) + DRO Thesis Reference

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 1. Email Context Summary

What Prof. Cardasso Addressed:

Your submitted objective used the term "influence" to describe the relationship between IT governance mechanisms (Digital Resource Orchestration and software license rationalization) and capital efficiency/firm performance.

The Core Methodological Issue (Direct Quote):
│ "In doctoral context, the term 'impact' is not neutral or lightweight. It carries strong conceptual and methodological implications, particularly in management and social-science research, where it is associated with demonstrable, measurable, and often causal effects."

Why This Matters Now:
Prof. Cardasso explicitly states he's working with incomplete information ("we don't have the full view with literature review, methods etc.") but addresses terminology precision now because it's foundational to your research design. The DBA Research Proposal Template (Section 1 - Introduction) requires your research statement to properly "safeguard the scope of your work."

His Terminology Hierarchy (Exact Definitions from Email):

| Term | Prof. Cardasso's Definition | Evidentiary Demand |
|------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Correlation | "Indicates that two variables vary together. Does not imply directionality or causation." | Lowest |
| Influence | "Suggests that variable X affects variable Y in some way. Direction is implied, but mechanism may remain unspecified, magnitude may vary, and causality may be theoretical rather than empirically proven." | Moderate |
| Impact | "Implies a substantial, measurable, and practically meaningful effect of X on Y. Both directional and outcome-oriented, therefore requires higher level of empirical and methodological rigor." | High |
| Moderation | "Third variable alters strength or direction of relationship between X and Y. Effect may be weak, conditional, or even absent when certain conditions are not met. Closer to association than to direct causation, operates at multifactor level." | Conditional |

His Specific Recommendation:
│ "Using 'moderation' for now might particularly suitable option if your findings reveal an association without requiring you to claim direct causality—an assertion that is often more complex and demanding to substantiate at the doctoral level. That said, this remains a suggestion rather than a prescription."

Your Task: "Determine which one you are confident you can rigorously support in your research."

## 2. Key Points to Address in Your Response

### ✓ Point 1: Acknowledge the Methodological Weight
Show you understand this isn't about word choice—it's about doctoral-level rigor. The DBA Proposal Template emphasizes that your research statement must be properly scoped and defensible.

### ✓ Point 2: Demonstrate Understanding of the Hierarchy
Reference his specific definitions to show you've internalized the conceptual differences between correlation/influence/impact/moderation.

### ✓ Point 3: State Your Preliminary Decision
Based on your research design capabilities, indicate which term you're leaning toward. Connect this to:
- Your data collection approach (from DRO Thesis Reference: "semi-structured interviews with 30-40 senior IT and Finance leaders")
- Your theoretical framework (Agency Theory, IT Governance literature)
- Your methodological constraints (qualitative-first or mixed-methods)

### ✓ Point 4: Request Clarification (If Needed)
If you're uncertain about which term fits your planned methodology, ask specific questions about how to align terminology with your research design.

### ✓ Point 5: Acknowledge Next Steps
Show you understand this decision affects your literature review framing and methodology chapter (even though those aren't complete yet).

## 3. Suggested Response Structure

### Opening
Dear Prof. Cardasso,

Thank you for your detailed feedback on the terminology in my research objective. I appreciate you addressing this foundational issue now, even while working with incomplete information about my literature review and methodology.


### Body Section 1: Demonstrate Understanding
What to Include:
- Acknowledge the conceptual weight of "impact" vs. "influence" vs. "moderation"
- Reference his hierarchy explicitly (shows you studied his email carefully)
- Connect to doctoral rigor requirements

Example Approach:
"Your explanation of the evidentiary demands for each term clarifies why precision matters at this stage. I now understand that [term X] requires [specific methodological capability], while [term Y] allows for [different scope]."

### Body Section 2: State Your Preliminary Decision
What to Include:
- Which term you're leaning toward (moderation, influence, or correlation)
- Why this aligns with your planned research design
- Reference your DRO Thesis materials (qualitative interviews, theoretical framework)

Example Approach:
"Given my planned approach of [describe methodology from DRO Thesis Reference], I believe [chosen term] is most appropriate because [specific justification tied to his definitions]."

Connect to Your DRO Thesis Context:
- You're investigating "zombie seats" (unused SaaS licenses) and governance mechanisms
- Your data: interviews with IT/Finance leaders (qualitative)
- Your framework: Agency Theory + IT Governance literature
- Your scope: mid-market tech firms

Which Term Fits?
- **Moderation**: If you're examining how governance mechanisms alter the strength of the relationship between SaaS waste and firm performance (conditional effect)
- **Influence**: If you're claiming governance mechanisms affect capital efficiency but not proving full causality
- **Correlation**: If you're only showing variables vary together without directionality

### Body Section 3: Request Guidance (If Applicable)
What to Include:
- Specific questions about aligning terminology with methodology
- Ask about implications for literature review framing

Example Approach:
"As I develop my literature review, should I frame my research gap around [chosen term] from the outset, or is it acceptable to refine this after pilot interviews reveal the nature of the relationship?"

### Closing
I will revise my objective to reflect [chosen term] and ensure my methodology chapter (when developed) supports this claim rigorously.

Thank you again for this guidance—it has clarified how terminology shapes the entire research design.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## 4. Tone Guidelines

Professional & Reflective:
- Show you've thought deeply about his feedback (not just acknowledging it)
- Use his exact terminology when referencing his hierarchy
- Avoid defensive language—frame this as learning

Engaged & Decisive:
- Don't be vague ("I'll think about it")—state a preliminary position
- Show you're connecting this to your broader research design
- Demonstrate forward momentum

Appropriately Tentative:
- Use "preliminary" or "leaning toward" (since lit review isn't complete)
- Acknowledge you may refine this as methodology develops
- Show openness to further guidance

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 5. Draft Template with [Placeholders]

Dear Prof. Cardasso,

Thank you for your detailed feedback on the terminology in my research objective. I appreciate you addressing this foundational issue now, even while working with incomplete information about my literature review and methodology.

Your explanation of the evidentiary hierarchy—from correlation (no directionality) to influence (directional but mechanism unspecified) to impact (substantial, measurable effect requiring high rigor) to moderation (conditional, multifactor relationship)—has clarified why precision matters at the doctoral level. I now understand that [TERM YOU USED] in my original objective carries [SPECIFIC METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS FROM HIS EMAIL].

Given my planned research design, I am leaning toward using [CHOSEN TERM: moderation/influence/correlation] because:

1. [REASON 1 TIED TO YOUR METHODOLOGY - e.g., "My qualitative interview approach with IT/Finance leaders will reveal associations and conditional relationships, but may not establish full causality"]

2. [REASON 2 TIED TO YOUR THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK - e.g., "Agency Theory suggests governance mechanisms alter managerial behavior, which aligns with a moderation framework where governance conditions the waste-performance relationship"]

3. [REASON 3 TIED TO YOUR SCOPE - e.g., "The DRO context involves multiple factors (turnover, governance maturity, firm size), making a multifactor moderation approach more defensible than claiming direct impact"]

[OPTIONAL: REQUEST CLARIFICATION]
As I develop my literature review, [SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT IMPLICATIONS - e.g., "should I frame my research gap around moderation from the outset, or is it acceptable to refine this terminology after pilot interviews reveal the nature of the relationship?"]

I will revise my objective to reflect [CHOSEN TERM] and ensure my methodology chapter (when developed) supports this claim rigorously. This decision will also guide how I frame my research contribution in the literature review.

Thank you again for this guidance—it has clarified how terminology shapes the entire research design.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
