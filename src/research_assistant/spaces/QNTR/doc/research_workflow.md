## Expected Input
- `task`: Research objective or methodology question

## Research Stages

### Stage 1: Literature & Theory Mapping
- Theoretical framework identification
- Key construct definitions
- Prior measurement approaches
- Research gap identification

### Stage 2: Methodology Design
- Research design selection
- Variable operationalization
- Measurement strategy
- Sampling plan

### Stage 3: Analysis Planning
- Statistical method selection
- Tool identification (SPSS/R/JASP/AMOS)
- Assumption requirements
- Expected outputs

## Grounding Rules

### MUST DO
- [ ] Map to course theoretical frameworks (RBV, ROT, DC)
- [ ] Connect to DRO research project examples
- [ ] Reference Prof. Prashar's methodology guidance
- [ ] Include validity considerations
- [ ] Recommend appropriate statistical tools

### MUST NOT DO
- [ ] Propose methodology without theoretical basis
- [ ] Skip validity framework
- [ ] Ignore sample size requirements
- [ ] Give generic research advice

## Priority Source Order
1. Research Papers (theoretical foundations)
2. Class Slides (methodology frameworks)
3. DRO Questionnaire (measurement examples)
4. Course Materials
5. Reference Materials
