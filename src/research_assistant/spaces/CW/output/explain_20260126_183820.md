━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 1. Conceptual Definition

Based on our course materials, case study ideas in academic research represent dilemma-focused narratives that examine real organizational decision points where protagonists face genuine uncertainty. As our knowledge base explicitly states: "Case Study is Dilemma focused; Teaching Note is Solutions Oriented and how to execute those solutions."

The fundamental principle is that effective cases focus on "learning how is a decision arrived at to generate multiple solutions" rather than teaching predetermined answers. Cases must answer the 5 W's (why, what, where, when, whom) and examine whether "solutions are sustainable."

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

Our current case portfolio spans three distinct theoretical domains, each grounded in established management frameworks:

### **Corporate Governance Theory**
The Tesla Board Governance Case (2018-2024) applies agency theory and stakeholder governance frameworks to examine "governance in a one-man controlled company." This addresses the core tension between value creation and board independence.

### **Crisis Management in MSME Context** 
The Ichalkaranji Textile Case applies resource-based view and crisis management theory to small-scale enterprises facing simultaneous external shocks—what our materials term a "perfect storm."

### **Operational Leadership Under Disruption**
The High-Stakes Reporting Crisis examines adaptive leadership frameworks during system failures affecting "time-sensitive data for inventory and finance decisions."

## 3. Key Components of Current Case Ideas

### **A. Tesla Board Governance Case**
Core Dilemma: "Can You Govern a Superstar CEO?" when board independence conflicts with value creation.

Key Decision Points:
- Executive compensation approval versus fiduciary duty
- Board composition balancing independence with industry expertise  
- Stakeholder management during Delaware litigation

Data Sources: Public filings, court documents, proxy statements, media coverage

### **B. Ichalkaranji Textile MSME Crisis**
Core Dilemma: How small manufacturers respond to simultaneous crises: "US 50% tariff + Maharashtra electricity tariff hike + MPCB pollution mandates."

Strategic Options Examined:
- Halt operations (preserve accuracy, risk revenue)
- Implement workarounds (maintain continuity, accept error risk)
- Transform business model (domestic pivot versus export dependency)

Data Sources: Owner interviews, industry reports, regulatory documents

### **C. Crisis Leadership in High-Stakes Operations**
Core Dilemma: Balancing "business continuity versus data integrity" during system failures.

Decision Framework:
- Stop all processes versus manual workarounds
- Targeted communication versus broad transparency
- Short-term fixes versus sustainable improvements

## 4. Practical Application

### **Teaching Effectiveness Criteria**
Our materials emphasize cases must be "teachable" by connecting to specific management frameworks. Each case addresses:

Tesla Case: Corporate governance, board effectiveness, executive compensation theory
Textile Case: Crisis management, MSME strategy, regulatory compliance
Leadership Case: Operational leadership, crisis communication, stakeholder management

### **Data Collection Standards**
Following our course guidelines: "Collect as much information as possible for your case. Later you can choose what to use for your case and what not."

Primary Sources: Interviews with protagonists (requires consent)
Secondary Sources: Public domain data when consent unavailable
Relevance: All cases maintain < 5-year timeframe per publisher requirements

## 5. Research Considerations

### **Most Promising Case: Tesla Board Governance**

Why This Case Shows Greatest Promise:

1. Contemporary Relevance: The December 2025 Delaware Supreme Court decision provides fresh resolution, making this highly current for 2026 teaching.

2. Multi-Stakeholder Complexity: Unlike single-protagonist cases, this examines board dynamics, shareholder activism, regulatory oversight, and CEO leadership simultaneously.

3. Theoretical Richness: Integrates corporate governance, agency theory, stakeholder management, and executive compensation frameworks in one narrative.

4. Data Accessibility: Extensive public documentation through SEC filings, court records, and media coverage eliminates consent barriers.

5. Universal Application: Governance challenges in founder-led companies apply across industries and geographies.

Research Methodology:
- Document analysis of proxy statements, litigation records, board minutes
- Timeline construction of governance decisions (2018-2024)
- Stakeholder mapping of competing interests
- Framework application testing across multiple governance theories

### **Ethical Considerations**
As our materials specify: "Need to have consent before publishing case. If consent not available then write based off secondary sources." The Tesla case's reliance on public domain sources eliminates ethical barriers while maintaining academic rigor.

### **Publisher Alignment**
The case structure follows established templates with clear protagonist dilemmas, multiple viable solutions, and sustainable outcome analysis—meeting requirements for major case publishers (Ivey, Emerald, Sage).

Conclusion: While all three cases offer valuable learning opportunities, the Tesla Board Governance case presents the most promising combination of theoretical depth, practical relevance, data accessibility, and teaching effectiveness for contemporary management education.
