## 1. Conceptual Definition

A case synopsis is fundamentally "a brief summary (150–200 words): what the case is about, central dilemma, and pedagogical focus" as explicitly defined in our Teaching Note Template. This concise abstract serves as the analytical foundation that distills complex organizational scenarios into their essential educational components.

The synopsis operates as both a diagnostic tool and pedagogical gateway—enabling instructors to rapidly assess case-course alignment while providing students the conceptual framework necessary for structured case engagement. It transforms sprawling organizational narratives into focused learning instruments.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

The case synopsis is grounded in three core pedagogical frameworks embedded within our course methodology:

Case Method Pedagogy: The synopsis preserves analytical depth while ensuring accessibility. Our course materials demonstrate this through the Tesla case: "Tesla's Board at a Crossroads: Governance in a One-Man Controlled Company (2018–2024)" immediately establishes organizational context, temporal scope, and governance focus within the 150-200 word constraint.

Problem-Centered Learning Architecture: Every synopsis must articulate the "central question or challenge the protagonist faces" as mandated in our Case Writing Template. This creates the analytical tension that drives student inquiry and decision-making practice.

Constructivist Learning Framework: The synopsis enables scaffolded engagement by establishing clear conceptual boundaries before students navigate case complexity, supporting progressive knowledge construction.

## 3. Key Components

Our course materials identify three mandatory synopsis elements with specific structural requirements:

### a) Organizational/Industry Context
Precise situational framing that establishes scope and relevance. The Ichalkaranji textile case exemplifies this specificity: "Family-owned small-scale MSME textile manufacturer" operating within "India's largest greige fabric production hub (~$170M daily turnover)" comprising "~2,000 small-scale powerloom units producing 40% of India's powerloom fabric."

### b) Central Dilemma Articulation
The core decision requiring resolution, formulated as a clear choice scenario. Our templates demonstrate varied approaches:
- **Tesla Governance**: "Can You Govern a Superstar CEO?" 
- **Textile Crisis**: "Survival or Transformation?" amid "US tariff shock + electricity cost hike + pollution compliance mandates"
- **Crisis Leadership**: "Halt operations and risk lost revenue for full data integrity [versus] implement a manual workaround, risking errors but maintaining business continuity"

### c) Pedagogical Focus Declaration
Explicit connection to theoretical frameworks and learning objectives. Our Crisis Leadership case states: "Applying and critiquing crisis management and resilience frameworks" while "practicing nuanced leadership judgment—choices no longer only about following a model, but integrating logic, experience, and context."

## 4. Practical Application

The synopsis serves multiple operational functions within our case-based pedagogy:

Pre-Class Preparation: Students use the synopsis to orient their case analysis, identifying key stakeholders and decision parameters before detailed reading.

Session Planning: Instructors leverage the synopsis to design the Teaching Plan structure outlined in our template—moving from "What's happening at the company?" (comprehension) through "What internal/external pressures shaped the issue?" (analysis) to "What would you recommend?" (synthesis).

Assessment Alignment: The synopsis ensures case selection matches course Learning Objectives. Our template requires "3–5 key objectives the case helps achieve" directly linked to the synopsis content.

## 5. Research Considerations

For doctoral and research students developing cases, the synopsis demands rigorous methodological attention:

Data Source Integration: The synopsis must reflect comprehensive "Potential Data Sources" including (a) Interviews (b) Documents (c) Reports (d) Public sources as specified in our Case Writing Template.

Ethical Accessibility: Researchers must ensure "Accessibility / Permissions" for data collection and usage, particularly when dealing with sensitive organizational information as demonstrated in our Ichalkaranji case where we note "[To be confirmed with owner consent—can be anonymized]".

Theoretical Grounding: The synopsis should connect to established frameworks within specific domains. Our materials show this through "Which area, concept, framework, or management theme does it connect to? For eg. Organizational Behavior, Marketing, Strategy, ESG etc."

Temporal Boundaries: Effective synopses establish clear chronological scope, as seen in our Tesla case spanning "2018–2024 (the governance journey), with a postscript noting December 2025 developments."

The case synopsis thus represents the critical intersection of pedagogical design and research rigor—transforming complex organizational realities into structured learning experiences while maintaining academic integrity and analytical depth.
