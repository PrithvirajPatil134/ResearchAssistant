## 1. Conceptual Definition

Based on the Course Knowledge Base materials, a case synopsis (also termed "Case Abstract") is defined as a "brief summary (150–200 words): what the case is about, central dilemma, and pedagogical focus" (Teaching Note Template). 

The synopsis serves as the foundational element of any teaching note, providing a concise overview that captures three critical dimensions:
- **Content scope**: The organizational context and situation
- **Decision challenge**: The specific dilemma requiring resolution
- **Educational purpose**: The learning objectives and pedagogical intent

As demonstrated in the Tesla Board Governance Case Template, the synopsis functions as an "Executive Summary (For Your Quick Reference)" that enables quick comprehension of the case's essence and teaching value.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

The case synopsis is grounded in established pedagogical frameworks from the Course Knowledge Base:

### Decision-Centered Learning Framework
The emphasis on "central dilemma" reflects the principle that effective cases are "dilemma focused" rather than solution-oriented. As noted in the course materials: "The idea is not to convince everyone about your solution... it is about learning how is a decision arrived at to generate multiple solutions."

### 5W Framework Application
The synopsis must address the fundamental questions outlined in the knowledge base: "Make sure your case answers the 5 W's (why, what, where, when, whom)." This ensures comprehensive coverage within the word constraint.

### Pedagogical Positioning Theory
The requirement to "specify the suitable course(s) and level (MBA, Executive, Undergraduate)" demonstrates how the synopsis serves curriculum design by clearly positioning the case within academic frameworks.

## 3. Key Components

Drawing directly from the Teaching Note Template and Case Writing Template, the synopsis must integrate:

### Structural Elements:
- **Organizational Context**: As shown in the Tesla case - "Organization: Tesla, Inc. Headquarters: Austin, Texas, USA"
- **Industry Dynamics**: Contextual factors affecting the decision environment
- **Protagonist Role**: The key decision-maker facing the dilemma
- **Temporal Boundaries**: Specific timeframe (e.g., "2018–2024" in the Tesla case)

### Content Requirements:
- **Central Question**: "What central question or challenge does the protagonist face?" (Case Writing Template)
- **Teachable Connection**: "Which area, concept, framework, or management theme does it connect to?" 
- **Decision Options**: Multiple viable alternatives requiring analysis

### Quality Criteria:
- **Relevance**: Cases must be "relevant (< 5 yrs)" as publishers determine relevance
- **Accessibility**: Based on available "secondary sources" when primary data unavailable
- **Sustainability Focus**: "Are the solutions sustainable?" - a key evaluative dimension

## 4. Practical Application

### In Teaching Note Development:
The synopsis serves as the opening section that guides subsequent elements. Following the Teaching Note Template sequence, it precedes and informs:
- Learning Objectives (3–5 key objectives)
- Course Positioning (MBA, Executive, Undergraduate levels)
- Assignment Questions design
- Teaching Plan structure

### In Case Selection Process:
The synopsis enables educators to evaluate case fit by providing quick assessment of:
- **Pedagogical Alignment**: Does the dilemma match course objectives?
- **Complexity Appropriateness**: Is the challenge suitable for student level?
- **Framework Application**: Can students apply relevant analytical tools?

### In Curriculum Integration:
As demonstrated in the Tesla case positioning across "OB, Strategy, HRM, Ethics," the synopsis facilitates cross-disciplinary application and course sequencing decisions.

## 5. Research Considerations

### Data Collection Requirements:
Based on the Course Knowledge Base, researchers developing case synopses must consider:

Source Accessibility: "Will you be able to collect and use the data ethically?" with preference for cases based on "publicly available data" or "secondary sources" when "data and information is already available for public reference."

Consent Management: "Need to have consent before publishing case" - the synopsis must reflect only ethically accessible information.

### Methodological Approach:
The knowledge base emphasizes both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, requiring researchers to:
- "Collect as much information as possible for your case. Later you can choose what to use"
- Ensure proper citation following "specific publishers (Ivey, Emerald, Sage etc) guideline"
- Focus on dilemma presentation rather than solution advocacy

### Quality Assurance:
The synopsis undergoes rigorous review processes where "case is reviewed, it is scrutinized" with detailed feedback mechanisms, requiring researchers to maintain high standards of accuracy and pedagogical relevance.

### Publisher Alignment:
"Different publishers have different guidelines; necessary to follow the publisher guidelines before submitting" - indicating that synopsis development must consider target publication requirements from the outset.

Key Takeaway: The case synopsis serves as both a pedagogical tool and a research artifact, requiring careful balance between concise communication and comprehensive coverage of the case's educational value and decision complexity.
