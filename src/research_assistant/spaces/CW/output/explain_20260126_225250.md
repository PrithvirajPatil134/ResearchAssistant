━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 1. Conceptual Definition

A Teaching Note is a confidential instructor's guide that accompanies a teaching case. The course materials establish the fundamental distinction:

│ "Case Study is Dilemma focused; Teaching Note is Solutions Oriented and how to execute those solutions." (Course Material 1)

The Teaching Note is explicitly "for self (whoever teaches the case)" and is never distributed to students. Its pedagogical purpose derives from this principle:

│ "The idea is not to convince everyone about your solution/teach everyone your solution, it is about learning how a decision is arrived at to generate multiple solutions. Are the solutions sustainable?" (Course Material 1)

For the Textile Factory Case, this means the case presents the owner's existential dilemma, while the Teaching Note guides instructors through multiple strategic responses and their sustainability implications.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 2. Theoretical Foundation

The Teaching Note framework rests on principles embedded in the course materials:

Dilemma-Solution Separation: Course Material 1 instructs to "focus more on dilemma and not on solution" in the case itself. The Teaching Note becomes the analytical space for solution exploration.

Evidence-Led Analysis: The Tesla case template (Course Material 4) mandates an "evidence-led and balanced" approach—"presenting both [protagonist's] value creation AND the governance concerns, without bias." Teaching Notes must structure this balanced evaluation.

The 5 W's Framework: Course Material 1 requires cases to "answer the 5 W's (why, what, where, when, whom)"—the Teaching Note guides instructors in drawing these elements through discussion.

Publisher Compliance: "Different publishers have different guidelines; necessary to follow the publisher guidelines before submitting" (Course Material 1). Teaching Notes undergo rigorous review—the course notes "4 pages of feedback" as typical scrutiny.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 3. Key Components: Complete Template

The following template directly applies Course Material 3's "Teaching Note Template" to the Textile Factory Case:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 1. Case Synopsis / Abstract
(150–200 words: what the case is about, central dilemma, and pedagogical focus)

This case examines an Ichalkaranji powerloom owner—a family-owned MSME with 20-50 looms and 30-50 workers—facing an existential decision amid converging crises. Per Course Material 2, the protagonist confronts a "perfect storm":

| External Shock | Impact on Small MSMEs (Course Material 2) |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| US 50% tariff (Aug 2024) | "Export orders cancelled; pricing collapsed; factories operating at 30-50% capacity" |
| Maharashtra electricity tariff hike (June 2025) | "Power costs rose ₹3.5-4/unit; margins compressed to near-zero or negative" |
| MPCB pollution mandates (2024-2025) | "~150 sizing units threatened with closure; bio-digester compliance costs ₹15-25 lakh per unit" |
| Bangladesh/Vietnam competition | "Lower-cost competitors with better infrastructure and trade agreements gaining market share" |

The central dilemma (Course Material 2): "How to respond to a 'perfect storm' of simultaneous crises... when the traditional export-focused business model appears broken?"

Pedagogical Focus: Strategic decision-making under resource constraints; MSME survival strategies; institutional pressures on small manufacturers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 2. Learning Objectives
(List 3–5 key objectives the case helps achieve)

Following Course Material 3's format and Course Material 5's guidance on "Tentative Learning Objectives":

1. Analyze how simultaneous external shocks (trade policy, regulatory mandates, cost escalation) create compounding pressures on MSMEs
2. Evaluate strategic options available to resource-constrained family businesses facing existential threats
3. Apply decision-making frameworks to assess trade-offs between survival, transformation, and exit strategies
4. Assess the sustainability of different strategic responses given the protagonist's constraints
5. Understand the role of industry cluster dynamics (Ichalkaranji's "~2,000 small-scale powerloom units"—Course Material 2) in shaping individual firm options

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 3. Position in Course

Suitable Courses (per Course Material 3):
- Strategic Management (MBA/Executive)
- Entrepreneurship & MSME Management
- Business Environment & Policy
- Operations Strategy

Topic Areas (per Course Material 5's "What Makes It Teachable?"): Strategy, Business Environment, MSME Management, Crisis Decision-Making

Level: MBA, Executive Education, or advanced undergraduate

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 4. Relevant Readings
(List all sources in APA style)

[Instructor to compile based on publisher guidelines—Course Material 1 emphasizes: "Very important to cite sources and relevant study material. How to cite? Refer to the specific publishers (Ivey, Emerald, Sage etc) guideline"]

Suggested categories:
- MSME strategy literature
- Trade policy impact studies
- Indian textile industry reports
- Decision-making under uncertainty frameworks

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 5. Supplementary Materials
(As applicable—Course Material 3)

- Ichalkaranji textile cluster industry data
- Maharashtra electricity tariff schedules (2024-2025)
- MPCB compliance requirement documents
- US tariff policy announcements (August 2024)
- Comparative cost structures: India vs. Bangladesh/Vietnam

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 6. Assignment Questions

Pre-Class Questions:
1. What are the key external shocks facing the protagonist? How do they interact?
2. What resources and capabilities does a 20-50 loom MSME typically possess?

In-Class Discussion Questions:
3. What strategic options are available to the factory owner?
4. How should the protagonist prioritize among competing pressures (tariffs, electricity costs, pollution compliance)?
5. What criteria should guide the "survival or transformation" decision?
6. Are the potential solutions sustainable? (per Course Material 1's emphasis)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 7. Teaching Plan
(Structured session plan per Course Material 3)

| Stage | Time (min) | Activity / Discussion Question | Purpose |
|-------|------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Introduction | 10 | "What is happening to this factory owner? What external forces are at play?" | Warm-up & comprehension; establish the 5 W's |
| Analysis | 20 | "How do the US tariff, electricity hike, and pollution mandates interact? Why is this a 'perfect storm'?" | Identify context; analyze compounding pressures |
| Decision | 25 | "What are the protagonist's options? What are the trade-offs of each?" | Apply frameworks; evaluate alternatives |
| Conclusion | 15 | "What would you recommend? Is your solution sustainable?" | Synthesize insights; test sustainability |

Optional Activities (per Course Material 3):
- Role-play: Students argue for different strategic options
- Poll: "Survive, Transform, or Exit?"—discuss distribution of responses
- For online classes: Breakout rooms for option analysis

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 8. Analysis / Suggested Answers
(Main analytical points or frameworks—Course Material 3)

Framework Application:

| Strategic Option | Pros | Cons | Sustainability Assessment |
|------------------|------|------|---------------------------|
| Survive (Cost-cutting) | Preserves existing operations; minimal capital required | Margins already "near-zero or negative"; doesn't address structural issues | Low—reactive, not transformative |
| Transform (Diversification/Upgrading) | Addresses root causes; potential for improved margins | Requires capital investment; uncertain market for new products | Medium—depends on execution and market access |
| Exit (Closure/Sale) | Stops losses; preserves remaining capital | Job losses (30-50 workers); loss of family business | N/A—terminal option |
| Collective Action (Industry association) | Addresses policy issues at scale; shared costs | Slow; uncertain outcomes; coordination challenges | Medium—depends on industry mobilization |

Key Teaching Takeaways:
1. Simultaneous shocks require integrated strategic responses
2. Resource constraints limit MSME options compared to larger firms
3. "Sustainable solutions" (Course Material 1) must address structural issues, not just symptoms
4. Industry cluster dynamics create both constraints and opportunities

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### 9. What Happened Next
(Epilogue—Course Material 3)

[To be completed based on actual case developments. Per Course Material 1: "Collect as much information as possible for your case. Later you can choose what to use for your case and what not."]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 4. Practical Application

Data Collection Guidance (per Course Material 1):

│ "Two ways to collect data: Quantitative, Qualitative"

For this case:
- **Primary data**: Owner interviews (requires consent—"Need to have consent before publishing case")
- **Secondary data**: "When data and information is already available for public reference or public domain" (Course Material 1)—industry reports, news articles, government policy documents

Relevance Check (Course Material 1): "Make sure the case is relevant (< 5 yrs); publishers decide what is relevant"—the 2024-2025 crisis timeline meets this criterion.

Accessibility (per Course Material 5): Confirm "Will you be able to collect and use the data ethically?" If consent unavailable, "write based off 'secondary sources'" (Course Material 1).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 5. Research Considerations

For Case Writers:

1. Consent Protocol: Course Material 1 is explicit—"Need to have consent before publishing case." The Case Idea Template (Course Material 2) notes the organization name is "To be confirmed with owner consent—can be anonymized."

2. Dilemma Focus: Resist the temptation to prescribe solutions in the case itself. Per Course Material 1: "Focus more on dilemma and not on solution."

3. Publisher Guidelines: "Different publishers have different guidelines; necessary to follow the publisher guidelines before submitting" (Course Material 1). Expect rigorous review—"4 pages of feedback" is typical.

4. Evidence Standards: Follow the Tesla template's mandate for "evidence-led and balanced" presentation (Course Material 4).

5. Keywords (per Course Material 5): MSME strategy, textile industry, trade policy, crisis decision-making, institutional pressures
