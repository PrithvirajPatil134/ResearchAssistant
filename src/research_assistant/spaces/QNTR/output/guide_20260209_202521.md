“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”  
- Lucius Annaeus Seneca  
 
On May 12, 2019, Ramasubramanian Sundararajan, Head of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Cartesian 
Consulting was watching the Indian Premier League (IPL) final match between Mumbai Indians (MI) and 
Chennai Super Kings (CSK). The match was filled with severa l twists and turns; finally, it was won by 
Mumbai Indians by just 1 run in the last ball of the match.  Ramasubramanian Su ndararajan (nicknamed 
Ramsu by his colleagues) joined Cartesian as the head of AI in 2017. Cartesian Consulting ha d been 
providing ana lytical solutions for various clients in diverse domains including sports. Ramsu was 
wondering how the teams selected the playing 11 from a group of around 25 players available to them for 
an important game such as IPL final.  It may be an eas y task for ex perts such as coaches of the team, but 
there are several fantasy sports companies which provide opportunity for anyone from the public to pick 
the best team for a sporting event.  Fantasy sports was becoming popular among millions of people across 
the worl d. Fantasy sports was a fast growing online game and was expected to reach USD 14.40 billion 
revenue by 20201.   
 
The main concern for lawmakers across th e world was whether fantasy sports was a game of skill or game 
of chance.  Edelman in 2016 claimed that fantasy sports was a nerds’ game2. Similarly, Jennifer Chu3 
claimed that fantasy sports involves real skill.  Authors such as Edelman and Jennifer Chu believed that 
the players of fantasy sports would need a better understanding of the sports,  how the players perform 
under different playing conditions, injury to players, and impact of weather and other playing conditions. 
For example, until June 2019 , Rafael Nadal won 12 of his 18 grand slam titles in the French Open, 
whereas Roger Federer won just one French Open out of his 20 grand slam titles. This is an example to 
show  that fantasy sports enthusiasts should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of players before 
selecting them. Ramsu wanted to see if data could be used to check whether fa ntasy sports was a game of 
chance or skill, especially whether skill is a dominant factor in winning fantasy sports competition as 
claimed by Edelman.   
 
ABOUT THE FANTASY SPORTS INDUSTRY   
 
Fantasy sports was a comp etition among fans that involved  building an imaginary team comprising real 
players.  Based on the actual performance of the players in a match, the fans were awarded points and 
they could win a prize4.  History of fantasy sports can be traced to the 1960s when Bill Gamson , former 
Professor of Psychology at Harvard and Michigan University constructed a game called “The Baseball

Seminar” .5 Daniel Okrent, student at the Michigan University learned about “Baseball Seminar”, and 
created his own version of  the fantasy sports cal led “rotisserie baseball ,6” whose  idea had been 
crystallized in a Manhattan restaurant named La Rotisserie Francaise .7  
 
In 2018, the fantasy sports market worth was USD 13.9 billion and expected to grow at a CAGR of 
13.7% reaching USD 26.4 billion in 2024 , according to a study carried out by Market Study Report LLC .8 
A study conducted by Fantasy Sports and Trade Association, claimed that the fantasy sports users grew at 
25% annually .9 With such high anticipated growth, channels such as ESPN broadcast hour -long shows 
devoted to fantasy sports and players prior to major sports seasons.   
 
In India, fantasy sports has been one of the most popular activities for sports lovers. The major reason for 
this surge in fantasy sports users could be the rise of league -based sports, and the growth of online 
viewership combined with increased smartphone penetration. Technological advancement has also 
contributed to the growth in popularity of fantasy sports in India. While cricket has dominated the sports 
market in India, t he new generation is exploring and getting interested in other sports such as Kabaddi, 
football, basketball , and hockey.  
 
The Indian fantasy sports market has shown a double -digit growth. A report by AC Nielsen, 
commissioned by the Indian Federation of Sports Gaming (IFSG) across 12 cities in India claimed that 
67% of the survey respondents were aware of fantasy sports and th e retention rate of users was 89% .10 In 
2019, India had more than 20 million fantasy sports users across 60 different platforms , which was 
expected to grow to 100 million users by 2020 .11 The s ame report claimed an increase in number of users 
by 200% in 2017 . While the U nited States and Canada had 59 million users in 2018, the Indian market 
saw an increase in users from 2 million users in 2016 to 20 million in 2018, more than the number of 
users in the United Kingdom.12 An interesting fact is that fantasy spor ts was witnessing  40% growth in 
female user participation during the International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup .13 
 
Fantasy sports and the gaming industry was set to witness a massive growth in India , growing from Rs . 
43.8 billion to reach Rs . 118.8 billion by FY23 at CAGR 22.1%, according to a report by Indian 
Federation of Sports Gaming (IFSG), India’s first and only self -regulatory industry body for the sports 
gaming sector and KPMG India Private Limited (KPMG)  (1$ = Rs. 68 approx, in July 2019) . The report

titled ‘The Evolving Landscape of Sports Gaming in India’ provides an overview of the online gaming 
industry with a focus on fantasy sports and eSports .14 
 
FANTASY SPORTS COMPANIES IN INDIA  
 
There were around 150+ online fantasy sports gaming companies in India such as Dream11, MyTeam11, 
HalaPlay, FirstGames, BalleBaazi, Fanmojo, and 11Wickets. Dream11 was the biggest fantasy sports 
company in India.  Dream11 was co -founded by Harsh Jain and Bhavit Seth in 2008; and  in 2012 , they 
introduced the freemium format of fantasy sports to the Indian  cricket fans. In 2014, the company 
reported 1 million registered users, which grew to 2 million in 2016 and to 60 million in 201815, 16 
[Exhibit 1].  In 2019, it was reported that Dream11 held 90% of the domestic fantasy sports market .17 In 
2018, Dream11 signed MS Dhoni, India’s ex -captain as their new brand ambassador and subsequently 
launched a media campaign under the banner  “Dimaag se Dhoni” during  Indian Premier League 2018 .18 
 
HalaPlay was founded by the students of Birla Institute of Technology (BITS) Pilani in 2017.  In 2019, 
HalaPlay reported 4 million users and 10 times growth over the last 12 months .19  MyTeam11, a Jaipur 
based startup was founde d in 2016 by two e ngineers and ha d around 10 million+ users.  
 
ONLINE GAMBLING LAWS ACROSS THE WORLD   
 
In the United States , fantasy sports were exempted from federal law concerning the U nlawful Internet 
Gambling Enforcement Act (IGEA) .20 It was left to a state -level decision; each state applied various 
standards to determine if fantasy sports was a game of skill or chance. The decision between skill and 
chance was to be decided based on whether the skill -based element was dominant over ch ance in 
determining the outcome of the game .21  
 
Most European countries recognized fantasy sports as a legal business; it was legal and highly regulated 
in around 30 countries in Europe. In Sweden, Croatia and Norway, though fantasy sports was legal, it wa s 
not very regulated. However, in countries such as Switzerland, Ukraine, Macedonia and Belarus, online 
gaming was considered illegal22. 
 
Online gambling laws have been  a state subject in India and respective states can formulate laws for 
various gaming activities.  Most of the laws governing the subject of gaming in India  in 2019  were old. 
The said laws use d a yardstick of 'Skill vs. Chance' and predominance of skill over chance to identify if a 
given game falls within the ambit of gambling. Advent of online games coupled with lack of awareness 
about them, created confusion as to how this yardstick of skill v ersus  chance or game of mere skill could

be applied.   The two  main enactments dealing with gaming in India were the Pre-Independence Public 
Gambling Act, 1867 (“PGA”) and the Prize Competitions Act, 1955 (“PCA”). In general, gambling laws 
of most states prohibited gambling .  Historically, Indian laws have differenti ated between the games of 
skill and games of chance. While the game of skill was permitted by Indian laws, game of chance was 
strictly prohibited .  
 
SKILL BASED VS. CHANCE BASED  
 
Games of skill are the games which involve  a person’s skill, knowledge and ju dgment and they rule out 
chance aspect from the game. On the other hand, games of chance include games that are determined by 
mere luck, completely uncertain and the players cannot apply their skill to estimate the result .23 
 
While deciding whether a game is a game of chance or skill, the Indian courts while interpreting the term 
“mere skill” have  adopted the methodology used by the US government, that is, the “dominant factor 
test”. It says that while classifying a game, it be comes important to check whether chance or skill is the 
dominant factor in determining the result of the game. Dominant factor test was applied to Rummy and 
Horse Racing. The Supreme Court of India classified Rummy as a game of skill, as the fall of cards need 
to be memorized and considerable skill is required while deciding whether to hold or discard a card .24 On 
similar lines, horse racing requires objective assessment of fitness and skill of the horse and the jockey.  
 
In 2018, the Supreme Court of India c oncurred with earlier verdicts by Punjab and Haryana High Courts 
that Fantasy sports involves substantial amount of skill.25  The High Court of Punjab and Haryana ruled 
that fantasy sports was predominantly a skill -based game.  The Telangana government has ruled that a 
game of skill which has an element of chance could not be described as skill games.  It is pertinent to note 
here that it is difficult to conceive of any game of skill as a game of pure skill and no chance. Some 
eleme nt of chance is always present in any game of skill. For instance, almost all forms of popular sports 
involving very high degrees of skill, such as chess, cricket, football, hockey , etc., also involve  some 
element of chance.  It becomes important to obtain  evidence from data by developing statistical models to 
test and classify fantasy games as a game of skill vs. game of chance.  If a fantasy sports is chance based, 
then every user should have an equal probability of winning, whereas if it is skill  based , then one should 
see consistent performance among the users.  The only way to check this is to use the data from a fantasy 
sports company.   
 
Ramsu approached Dream11 with a request to share anonymized data for testing whether fantasy sports 
involving crick et was skill dominant or chance dominant.  Dream11 agreed to share their data and rules 
related to fantasy sports , which are described in Exhibits 2, 3 and 4.

DATA ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY  
 
After receiving the data26 from Dream11, Ramsu  called for a meeting of his team with an objective to 
determine  whether fantasy sports was skill dominant or chance dominant.  Ramsu opened the meeting by 
stating:  
 
I think the biggest challenge in this case is to understand the key difference between ski ll 
and chance and how to test it using the data.  
  
Tapan Khopkar, who was the domain expert on fantasy sports in the team , responded:  
 
Games such as rummy and horse racing are classified as skill based since in rummy we 
need to decide to play or hold the card based on knowledge of our own cards and our 
skill to understand other players’ cards. Similarly, in horse racing , the performance, skill 
and fitness are the deciding factors to put money on a horse. In case of fantasy cricket, 
the users need a goo d understanding of the strengths and weakness of each player, 
playing conditions, information related to injury and so on.  
 
Ramsu responded:  
 
Yes, I agree Tapan. To prove that it is skill dominant, we have to prove that users who are 
scoring high in fanta sy sports are playing a strategic game, their selection of players and 
captain and vice -captain is more knowledge based than random selection.  
 
Alolika, who was a senior data scientist in the team said : 
 
If fantasy games involve skill, then we can expect consistency in the performance of the 
users both low as well as high.  Alternatively, we can also check whether a selection 
specific player increases probability of winning fantasy sports.   
 
Ramsu summari zed:  
 
I think our approach should be to identify and test several possible hypotheses to 
establish whether fantasy sports is skill dominant or chance dominant.   
 
There was a consensus about the approach in the team and they decided to go ahead with the s tatistical 
analysis of data by framing and testing several hypotheses.  
 
DATA DESCRIPTION AND HYPOTHESES  
 
The data available for analysis was provided in various tables. The overall hierarchy of data is as follows .

- Various rounds/match were played. For exam ple, one IPL match would be one round.  
- There were players who were available to be picked up for a round or match. (This number is more 
than the number of players who would actually play in that match, so it was possible that a player 
selected by a user in  his team may not actually play.)  
- For every round, multiple contests were opened. The contests were of different categories, from free to 
paid, and various types of playing and winning options (public, private, special ). 
- User selected a team for a round an d for a contest.  
- There was a player round performance table which indicated how the player performed in the specific 
round.  
- Teams selected by users were scored on the basis of the selected player’s performance in a contest and 
those team level scores were provided in the contest user’s table.  
 
Description and details of the data are described in Exhibit s 4 and 5. 
 
Using the data , one can validate several hypotheses to infer whether fantasy sports is skill dominant or 
chance dominant.  Few possible hypotheses are listed below:  
 
1. Users playing free contests are scoring lower than users playing paid contests. This can prove that 
when users play paid contests, they play more cautiously and strategically, and do not select teams at 
random.  
2. Scores of randomly selected players can be tested against scores of the teams based on a specific 
strategy such as selecting players who have perform ed well in the recent matches.  
3. Is the selection of captains and vice captains of the team random (equal probability)?  
4. Selection of players and winning or getting high scores are dependent  on each other .  
5. As the user plays more games, his chance of winning  increases (learning effect) .

# Research Guidance: Fantasy Sports Case Study Analysis

Based on: Prof. Atul Prashar's QNTR Course Outline (Term I, AY 2025-26)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 1. Understanding the Task

This case study requires you to apply quantitative research methods to determine whether fantasy sports is a game of skill or chance using real data from Dream11. Based on the course outline, this aligns with:

- **Sessions 1-2**: Research orientation, research process, internal & external validity
- **Session 3**: Scales, constructs & measurement
- **Session 4+**: Data analysis tools (SPSS, R, JASP)
- **Course Objective**: "Apply basic and advanced statistical methods, including computer-based data analysis"

The case presents a hypothesis testing problem where you must use statistical evidence to classify fantasy sports legally and scientifically.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 2. Suggested Approach/Framework

### Research Design Framework (From Course Sessions 1-2)

Research Question: Is fantasy sports skill-dominant or chance-dominant?

Design Type: Descriptive-Causal Hybrid
- **Descriptive**: Characterize user performance patterns
- **Causal**: Test whether skill (strategic selection) causes winning

Variables Framework:

| Variable Type | Construct | Measurement |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Independent Variables (IVs) | User skill indicators | - Contest type (free vs. paid)<br>- Player selection strategy<br>- Captain/vice-captain choices<br>- User experience (games played) |
| Dependent Variable (DV) | Performance outcome | - Points scored<br>- Win/loss status<br>- Consistency across rounds |
| Control Variables | Contextual factors | - Round ID<br>- Contest size<br>- Contest category |

### Statistical Methods (From Course Materials)

Based on the class notes (11/01 session), you should:

1. Use existing measures from literature (skill vs. chance classification)
2. Control for extraneous variables (contest type, round effects)
3. Validate with multiple tests (not just one hypothesis)
4. Check internal validity (does skill actually cause winning?)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 3. Relevant KB Materials

### From Course Outline:
- **Session 3**: "Measure of central tendency & dispersion and their visualization" → Use for comparing free vs. paid contest scores
- **Session 4**: "Introduction to data analysis tools" → SPSS/R/JASP for hypothesis testing
- **Class Notes (11/01)**: "Control variables are identified in the literature research" → Review legal precedents on skill vs. chance

### From Class Notes (12/06):
- **Cohen's Effect Size Standards**:
  - Weak impact: 0 - 0.2
  - Medium impact: 0.2 - 0.5
  - High impact: >0.5
- **Standard Deviation** is better than range for measuring dispersion
- **Predictor variables should be on the same scale** → Consider z-score normalization

### Data Tables Provided (Exhibit 3):
- CONTEST_MASTER: Contest characteristics
- CONTEST_USER_RELATION: User scores per contest
- PLAYER_ROUND_PERFORMANCE: Player actual performance
- USER_ROUND_PLAYER: Team selections (11 players + captain/vice-captain)
- AGGREGATE_DATA: User performance across multiple rounds

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 4. Step-by-Step Guidance

### Phase 1: Data Preparation (SPSS/R)

Step 1.1: Load all CSV files into SPSS or R
r
# Example R code structure
contest_master <- read.csv("CONTEST_MASTER.CSV")
contest_user <- read.csv("CONTEST_USER_RELATION.CSV")
player_perf <- read.csv("PLAYER_ROUND_PERFORMANCE.CSV")
user_team <- read.csv("USER_ROUND_PLAYER.CSV")
aggregate <- read.csv("AGGREGATE_DATA.CSV")


Step 1.2: Merge tables using keys (roundid, contestid, userid, teamid)
- Join CONTEST_USER_RELATION with CONTEST_MASTER on contestid
- Join with USER_ROUND_PLAYER on teamid and roundid

Step 1.3: Create derived variables:
- **User experience**: Count of games played per user (from AGGREGATE_DATA)
- **Captain selection frequency**: How often each player is chosen as captain
- **Score consistency**: Standard deviation of user scores across rounds

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Testing

The case suggests 5 hypotheses (Page 7). Test each systematically:

#### **Hypothesis 1**: Users in paid contests score higher than free contests

Statistical Test: Independent samples t-test
- **IV**: Contest category (free vs. paid)
- **DV**: Current points scored
- **SPSS**: Analyze → Compare Means → Independent-Samples T Test
- **Expected Result**: If skill-dominant, paid users should score significantly higher (p < 0.05)

From Class Notes: Report effect size using Cohen's d (>0.5 = high impact)

#### **Hypothesis 2**: Strategic selection outperforms random selection

Statistical Test: Simulation + t-test
1. Create random teams (11 players selected randomly from available pool)
2. Calculate scores for random teams using PLAYER_ROUND_PERFORMANCE
3. Compare random team scores vs. actual user scores
4. SPSS: One-sample t-test (test if actual scores > random scores)

From Course: This tests internal validity (does strategy cause better outcomes?)

#### **Hypothesis 3**: Captain/vice-captain selection is non-random

Statistical Test: Chi-square goodness-of-fit test
- **Null hypothesis**: All players have equal probability of being selected as captain
- **Expected frequency**: Total captain selections / number of available players
- **Observed frequency**: Actual captain selection counts from USER_ROUND_PLAYER
- **SPSS**: Analyze → Nonparametric Tests → Legacy Dialogs → Chi-square

Expected Result: If skill-dominant, certain high-performing players should be selected disproportionately (p < 0.05)

#### **Hypothesis 4**: Player selection and winning are dependent

Statistical Test: Chi-square test of independence
1. Create contingency table: Player selected (Yes/No) × Win status (Top 10% scorers vs. others)
2. Test if selecting specific high-performing players increases win probability
3. SPSS: Analyze → Descriptive Statistics → Crosstabs → Chi-square

From Class Notes: Use Cramer's V to measure effect size (association strength)

#### **Hypothesis 5**: Learning effect exists (experience improves performance)

Statistical Test: Correlation or regression analysis
- **IV**: Number of games played (from AGGREGATE_DATA)
- **DV**: Average score per user
- **SPSS**: Analyze → Regression → Linear
- **Expected Result**: Positive correlation (r > 0.3, p < 0.05) indicates learning effect

From Class Notes (12/06): Check if predictor variables are on same scale; use z-scores if needed

### Phase 3: Validity Checks (From Course Sessions 1-2)

Internal Validity:
- [ ] Did you control for round effects? (Some rounds may be easier)
- [ ] Did you control for contest size? (Smaller contests may have different dynamics)
- [ ] Are there confounding variables? (e.g., user demographics)

External Validity:
- [ ] Can results generalize beyond these 2 rounds (5365, 6349)?
- [ ] Do results apply to other sports (football, kabaddi)?
- [ ] Sample representativeness: Are these typical IPL/ODI matches?

### Phase 4: Reporting Results

Structure (Based on Course Objective: "communicating research results"):

1. Introduction: Research question, legal context (skill vs. chance test)
2. Methodology: 
   - Data description (2 rounds, 385,235 users, 74,220 contests)
   - Variables operationalization
   - Statistical tests used
3. Results: 
   - Descriptive statistics (means, SDs) for each group
   - Hypothesis test results (t-values, p-values, effect sizes)
   - Visualizations (boxplots, bar charts)
4. Discussion:
   - Interpret findings in legal context (dominant factor test)
   - Address validity threats
   - Practical implications for Dream11
5. Conclusion: Skill-dominant or chance-dominant verdict with evidence

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 5. Reflection Questions

Before starting analysis, consider:

1. Measurement Validity: 
   - Does "points scored" truly measure skill? Could luck still play a role in player performance?
   - How do you separate user skill from player luck (injury, weather)?

2. Sample Representativeness:
   - Are these 2 rounds (IPL T20, ODI) representative of all fantasy sports?
   - Do free contest users represent casual players vs. paid contest "experts"?

3. Causality:
   - If paid users score higher, is it because they're more skilled, or because they're more motivated?
   - How do you prove skill causes winning, not just correlates with it?

4. Legal Threshold:
   - What statistical threshold proves "skill is dominant"? Is p < 0.05 sufficient for legal purposes?
   - Should you use multiple testing correction (Bonferroni) since you're testing 5 hypotheses?

5. Practical Significance:
   - Even if results are statistically significant, are effect sizes large enough to matter legally?
   - From class notes: Cohen's d > 0.5 is "high impact" — should this be your threshold?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 7. Additional Context Questions

To provide more specific guidance on statistical power and sample size, it would help to know:

1. Software Preference: Will you use SPSS, R, or JASP? (Course mentions all three)
2. Reporting Format: Is this for a term paper, presentation, or both?
3. Time Constraints: How much time do you have? (Full analysis could take 10-15 hours)
4. Prior Experience: Have you used these statistical tests before, or do you need step-by-step SPSS screenshots?

However, you can proceed immediately with the framework above using the course materials and data provided.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Key Takeaway: This case study is designed to apply Sessions 1-4 of the course outline. Focus on:
1. Operationalizing constructs (skill = strategic selection, consistency)
2. Testing multiple hypotheses (triangulation increases validity)
3. Reporting effect sizes (Cohen's d, Cramer's V) alongside p-values
4. Connecting to legal framework (dominant factor test from Indian courts)

The class notes (11/01, 12/06) emphasize using existing measures, controlling variables, and validating findings — all critical for this analysis.
