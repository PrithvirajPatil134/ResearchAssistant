> # Digital Resource Orchestration and Capital Efficiency in SaaS Management

## A Doctoral-Level Conceptual Explanation

Prof. Cardasso | Bordeaux Business School

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 1. Conceptual Definition

Digital Resource Orchestration (DRO) refers to the systematic governance, allocation, and optimization of digital assets—particularly SaaS subscriptions and cloud-based tools—to maximize capital efficiency within technology enterprises.

From the course materials, DRO is positioned as an internal governance mechanism that addresses a specific problem: modern tech enterprises systematically waste 20–50% of their SaaS budgets through "zombie seats"—unused licenses caused by employee turnover and poor governance. This capital destruction is largely invisible to boards and investors yet represents a measurable drag on firm efficiency and returns.

Capital efficiency in this context measures how effectively a firm converts its digital resource investments into productive output, typically assessed through metrics like Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

The core research question from your thesis materials frames this precisely:

│ *"How do internal governance mechanisms—specifically SaaS rationalization and digital resource orchestration—mitigate capital inefficiency, and to what extent does this operational discipline drive superior ROIC in mid-market technology firms?"*

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 2. Theoretical Foundation

Your course materials identify a critical theoretical gap that positions this research:

### Existing Literature Streams
| Stream | Focus | Limitation |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Software Asset Management (SAM) | Compliance | Does not link to financial performance |
| IT Governance | Strategy alignment | Lacks tactical asset-level analysis |

### Theoretical Lenses for DRO Research

Agency Theory — Your materials explicitly recommend this for exploring why managers over-provision SaaS resources. Key questions include:
- Is over-provisioning driven by risk aversion ("better to have it and not need it")?
- Or does it reflect governance failures and information asymmetry between IT managers and executives?

Resource-Based View (RBV) — Positions DRO capability as a potential source of competitive advantage when it enables superior capital deployment.

Dynamic Capabilities Framework — Relevant for understanding how firms sense, seize, and reconfigure digital resources in response to changing operational needs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 3. Key Components

From the course materials, DRO encompasses several critical dimensions:

### 3.1 Strategic Slack vs. Waste Distinction

Your materials emphasize this is not a binary waste-elimination problem:

| Category | Definition | Managerial Intent |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Strategic Slack | Intentional "scaling buffers"—paying for extra seats to ensure agility during growth spurts | Deliberate, value-creating |
| Operational Neglect | Orphaned accounts from turnover, duplicate subscriptions, ungoverned procurement | Unintentional, value-destroying |

This distinction is methodologically crucial—researchers must differentiate between these categories rather than treating all unused capacity as waste.

### 3.2 The Cost of Rigidity

The materials raise an important counterpoint: strict financial discipline (zero-waste policies) may inadvertently stifle operational agility or slow project scaling. This creates a research tension between:
- **Efficiency** (minimizing waste)
- **Flexibility** (maintaining capacity for rapid scaling)

### 3.3 Governance Mechanisms

DRO requires formal governance structures including:
- License lifecycle management
- Automated deprovisioning workflows
- Centralized SaaS procurement policies
- Usage monitoring and analytics

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 4. Practical Application

### For Practitioners

DRO manifests in operational practices such as:
- Regular SaaS audits identifying zombie seats
- Integration of HR systems with IT provisioning (automatic deprovisioning on termination)
- Centralized procurement to prevent shadow IT proliferation
- Usage-based license optimization

### For Your Thesis Proposal

The materials indicate this research has practical implications for:
- **Investors** — DRO metrics as leading indicators of operational discipline
- **CFOs** — Quantifying the capital efficiency impact of SaaS governance
- **Boards** — Visibility into previously "invisible" capital destruction

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 5. Research Considerations

### Methodological Approach

Your course materials explicitly address the data collection challenge:

│ *"Quantitative data on 'waste' is highly sensitive and protected."*

The recommended approach is mixed-methods or qualitative-first:

| Phase | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Semi-structured interviews (30-40 senior IT/Finance leaders) | Capture strategic rationale—the "why" behind provisioning decisions |
| Secondary | Quantitative analysis (if data accessible) | Link rationalization practices to ROIC outcomes |

### Key Research Design Considerations

1. Unit of Analysis — Mid-market technology firms (as specified in your research question)

2. Construct Operationalization — How will you measure:
   - SaaS rationalization (input variable)
   - DRO maturity (governance mechanism)
   - Capital efficiency/ROIC (outcome variable)

3. Anonymity Protocols — Essential given data sensitivity; your materials note interviews should be conducted "under anonymity"

4. Theoretical Contribution — Your thesis fills a documented gap: "no research quantitatively links tactical asset rationalization to financial performance"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## Mapping to Your Thesis Proposal Structure

| Proposal Section | DRO/Capital Efficiency Relevance |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Introduction | Problem statement: 20-50% SaaS waste, invisible to boards |
| Literature Review | Gap between SAM (compliance) and IT governance (strategy) |
| Theoretical Framework | Agency Theory, RBV, Dynamic Capabilities |
| Methodology | Mixed-methods; qualitative-first given data sensitivity |
| Expected Contribution | First quantitative link between tactical rationalization and firm performance |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## Summary

Digital Resource Orchestration represents an emerging research domain at the intersection of IT governance, financial performance, and operational efficiency. Your thesis materials position this as addressing a genuine theoretical gap with significant practical implications. The key methodological challenge—accessing sensitive waste data—necessitates a qualitative-first approach that captures managerial intent before attempting quantitative performance linkages.

The strategic slack vs. waste distinction is particularly important: rigorous research must avoid the simplistic assumption that all unused capacity represents inefficiency.
