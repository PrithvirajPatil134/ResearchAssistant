On May 12, 2019, Ramasubramanian Sundararajan, Head of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Cartesian 
Consulting was watching the Indian Premier League (IPL) final match between Mumbai Indians (MI) and 
Chennai Super Kings (CSK). The match was filled with severa l twists and turns; finally, it was won by 
Mumbai Indians by just 1 run in the last ball of the match.  Ramasubramanian Su ndararajan (nicknamed 
Ramsu by his colleagues) joined Cartesian as the head of AI in 2017. Cartesian Consulting ha d been 
providing ana lytical solutions for various clients in diverse domains including sports. Ramsu was 
wondering how the teams selected the playing 11 from a group of around 25 players available to them for 
an important game such as IPL final.  It may be an eas y task for ex perts such as coaches of the team, but 
there are several fantasy sports companies which provide opportunity for anyone from the public to pick 
the best team for a sporting event.  Fantasy sports was becoming popular among millions of people across 
the worl d. Fantasy sports was a fast growing online game and was expected to reach USD 14.40 billion 
revenue by 20201.   
 
The main concern for lawmakers across th e world was whether fantasy sports was a game of skill or game 
of chance.  Edelman in 2016 claimed that fantasy sports was a nerds’ game2. Similarly, Jennifer Chu3 
claimed that fantasy sports involves real skill.  Authors such as Edelman and Jennifer Chu believed that 
the players of fantasy sports would need a better understanding of the sports,  how the players perform 
under different playing conditions, injury to players, and impact of weather and other playing conditions. 
For example, until June 2019 , Rafael Nadal won 12 of his 18 grand slam titles in the French Open, 
whereas Roger Federer won just one French Open out of his 20

In 2018, the fantasy sports market worth was USD 13.9 billion and expected to grow at a CAGR of 
13.7% reaching USD 26.4 billion in 2024 , according to a study carried out by Market Study Report LLC .8 
A study conducted by Fantasy Sports and Trade Association, claimed that the fantasy sports users grew at 
25% annually .9 With such high anticipated growth, channels such as ESPN broadcast hour -long shows 
devoted to fantasy sports and players prior to major sports seasons.   
 
In India, fantasy sports has been one of the most popular activities for sports lovers. The major reason for 
this surge in fantasy sports users could be the rise of league -based sports, and the growth of online 
viewership combined with increased smartphone penetration. Technological advancement has also 
contributed to the growth in popularity of fantasy sports in India. While cricket has dominated the sports 
market in India, t he new generation is exploring and getting interested in other sports such as Kabaddi, 
football, basketball , and hockey.  
 
The Indian fantasy sports market has shown a double -digit growth. A report by AC Nielsen,

# Research Design Guidance: Fantasy Sports Case Study Analysis

Following Prof. Atul Prashar's Quantitative Methods Framework

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 1. Understanding the Task

The Fantasy Sports case presents a classification problem requiring quantitative analysis to determine whether fantasy sports is a "game of skill" or "game of chance." Based on the Course Outline (QNTR 2025), this aligns with:

- **Session 1-2**: Research orientation, research philosophies, internal & external validity
- **Session 3**: Scales, constructs & measurement
- **Session 4**: Data analysis tools (SPSS, R, JASP)
- **Pedagogy**: Interactive & Case-based Learning requiring pre-class preparation and active participation

The case requires you to:
1. Frame a research question around skill vs. chance classification
2. Identify appropriate variables and measurement approaches
3. Apply statistical methods to analyze the phenomenon
4. Draw evidence-based conclusions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 2. Suggested Approach/Framework

### Research Design Type: Descriptive-Analytical Study

Rationale: The case requires understanding and classifying an existing phenomenon (fantasy sports) based on observable characteristics and outcomes.

### Recommended Methodology Framework

#### Phase 1: Problem Formulation
- **Research Question**: "To what extent is fantasy sports performance determined by skill versus chance?"
- **Hypothesis Development**:
  - H1: Player performance in fantasy sports is significantly correlated with domain knowledge (skill indicator)
  - H2: Consistency of player rankings over time indicates skill dominance over chance
  - H3: Expert players outperform novice players significantly (skill indicator)

#### Phase 2: Variable Identification

| Variable Type | Construct | Measurement Consideration | Data Source |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Dependent | Fantasy Sports Performance | Points scored, ranking, win rate | Platform data |
| Independent (Skill Indicators) | Domain Knowledge | Years of experience, sports knowledge test score | Survey/Platform |
| Independent (Skill Indicators) | Analytical Ability | Time spent on research, data sources used | Survey |
| Independent (Chance Indicators) | Random Events | Injury occurrences, weather disruptions | Historical data |
| Control | Platform Type | Daily vs. Season-long fantasy | Platform classification |
| Control | Sport Type | Cricket, Football, Basketball | Game classification |

#### Phase 3: Data Collection Strategy

Primary Data (if conducting new research):
- Survey of fantasy sports players (n ≥ 200 for statistical power)
- Likert scales (1-5) for measuring:
  - Sports knowledge depth
  - Time investment in analysis
  - Confidence in predictions

Secondary Data (from case and external sources):
- Historical performance data from fantasy platforms
- Player consistency metrics across seasons
- Expert vs. novice performance comparisons

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 3. Relevant KB Materials

### From Course Outline (QNTR 2025 ver 3):

Session 1-2 Focus:
- "Developing research orientation"
- "Research philosophies"
- "Internal & external validity"
- **Application**: Frame your research question considering both internal validity (does skill actually cause better performance?) and external validity (can findings generalize across sports/platforms?)

Session 3 Focus:
- "Scales, constructs & measurement"
- "The Variate & its measurement scales"
- "Measure of central tendency & dispersion"
- **Application**: Design measurement scales for "skill" constructs (knowledge, experience, analytical ability)

Session 4 Focus:
- "Introduction to data analysis tools"
- "Hands-on with SPSS, R, JASP"
- **Application**: Use correlation analysis, regression, or ANOVA to test skill vs. chance hypotheses

### From Class Notes (11/01 & 12/06):

Key Principles:
1. "Look for constructs already available as measures" - Search literature for existing "skill" and "chance" measurement scales in gaming/sports contexts
2. "Control variables are identified in the literature research" - Review papers on fantasy sports to identify confounding variables
3. "Deductive approach preferred" - Start with existing theories (e.g., skill-based game theory) and test them
4. "Validity considerations":
   - Internal validity: Higher in controlled settings
   - External validity: Consider generalizability across different fantasy sports platforms

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 4. Step-by-Step Guidance

### Step 1: Literature Review (Week 1)
- [ ] Search Google Scholar: "fantasy sports" AND ("skill" OR "chance") AND "quantitative"
- [ ] Identify existing measurement scales for:
  - Gaming skill assessment
  - Chance/randomness in competitive games
  - Performance consistency metrics
- [ ] Document 5-7 key papers with their methodologies

### Step 2: Research Question Refinement (Week 1)
- [ ] Narrow focus: Choose ONE sport (e.g., cricket IPL) for manageable scope
- [ ] Define operational definitions:
  - **Skill**: Measurable through knowledge tests, experience, consistency
  - **Chance**: Measurable through unpredictable events, variance in outcomes
- [ ] Write 2-3 testable hypotheses

### Step 3: Variable Operationalization (Week 2)
- [ ] Create measurement table:
 
  Construct → Indicator → Measurement Scale → Data Source
  Example:
  Skill → Sports Knowledge → 10-item quiz (0-10 score) → Primary survey
  Skill → Experience → Years playing (ratio scale) → Platform data
  Performance → Win Rate → % wins (ratio scale) → Platform data
  

### Step 4: Data Analysis Plan (Week 2)
- [ ] Descriptive Statistics: Mean, SD, range for all variables
- [ ] Correlation Analysis: Pearson's r between skill indicators and performance
- [ ] Regression Analysis: Multiple regression with skill/chance predictors
  - DV: Fantasy sports performance score
  - IVs: Knowledge score, experience, analytical time, random event exposure
- [ ] Group Comparison: t-test or ANOVA comparing expert vs. novice players
- [ ] Tool Selection: SPSS for regression, R for advanced modeling

### Step 5: Validity Framework (Week 2)
- [ ] Internal Validity Threats:
  - Selection bias: Ensure random sampling across skill levels
  - Confounding: Control for platform differences, sport type
- [ ] External Validity Considerations:
  - Can findings apply to other sports beyond cricket?
  - Do results hold for different fantasy platforms (Dream11 vs. others)?

### Step 6: Expected Outcomes & Interpretation (Week 3)
- [ ] If skill dominates: High correlations (r > 0.5) between knowledge/experience and performance; low variance in expert player outcomes
- [ ] If chance dominates: Low correlations (r < 0.3); high variance even among experts
- [ ] Mixed model: Moderate correlations; skill explains 30-60% of variance

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 5. Reflection Questions

1. Construct Validity: How will you ensure your "skill" measures actually capture player ability and not just luck or platform familiarity?

2. Measurement Precision: What is the appropriate sample size to detect a meaningful difference between skilled and unskilled players? (Hint: Power analysis with α=0.05, β=0.20)

3. Theoretical Grounding: Which theory best explains skill-based performance in competitive games? (Consider: Resource-Based View, Expertise Development Theory, Decision-Making Under Uncertainty)

4. Confounding Variables: The case mentions "injury to players, weather conditions" - how will you separate player skill from uncontrollable random events in your analysis?

5. Generalizability: If you find skill dominates in cricket fantasy sports, can you claim the same for football or basketball fantasy sports? Why or why not?

6. Ethical Considerations: Fantasy sports involves real money - how does this affect your research design and interpretation of "skill vs. chance"?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 6. Draft Analysis Framework

### Proposed Statistical Model

Performance_Score = β₀ + β₁(Knowledge) + β₂(Experience) + β₃(Analysis_Time) 
                    + β₄(Random_Events) + β₅(Platform_Type) + ε

Where:
- Performance_Score: Standardized fantasy points (z-score)
- Knowledge: Sports knowledge test score (0-100)
- Experience: Years playing fantasy sports (continuous)
- Analysis_Time: Hours spent on pre-game research (continuous)
- Random_Events: Count of unpredictable events affecting player's team
- Platform_Type: Categorical (Daily=1, Season-long=0)


### Expected Output Table

| Predictor | β Coefficient | Std. Error | t-value | p-value | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Knowledge | ? | ? | ? | ? | Skill indicator |
| Experience | ? | ? | ? | ? | Skill indicator |
| Analysis_Time | ? | ? | ? | ? | Skill indicator |
| Random_Events | ? | ? | ? | ? | Chance indicator |

Decision Rule (following Cohen's effect size from class notes 12/06):
- If R² > 0.50 (High impact): Skill-dominant game
- If R² = 0.20-0.50 (Medium impact): Mixed skill-chance game
- If R² < 0.20 (Weak impact): Chance-dominant game

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## 7. Questions for Additional Context

To provide more specific guidance, it would help to know:

1. Assignment Scope: Is this a proposal (research design only) or full analysis (requiring data collection and SPSS output)?

2. Data Availability: Do you have access to actual fantasy sports platform data, or should the approach focus on secondary data from the case?

3. Timeline: What is the submission deadline? This affects whether you can conduct primary surveys or must rely on case data.

4. Deliverable Format: Is the expected output a research proposal, statistical analysis report, or case discussion memo?

5. Team vs. Individual: Is this a group project (as mentioned in course pedagogy) or individual assignment?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## Key Takeaways from Prof. Prashar's Framework

✅ Deductive > Inductive: Start with existing skill-chance theories, don't try to build new theory

✅ Validity First: Address internal and external validity explicitly in your design

✅ Measurement Rigor: Use established scales from literature; cite sources for all constructs

✅ Statistical Power: Ensure adequate sample size (n ≥ 200 for regression with 5+ predictors)

✅ Tool Proficiency: Demonstrate SPSS/R skills as emphasized in Session 4

✅ Literature Grounding: Every variable and hypothesis must be justified with citations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Next Steps: 
1. Clarify assignment deliverable format with Prof. Prashar
2. Begin literature search for fantasy sports skill measurement scales
3. Draft research hypotheses based on case evidence
4. Prepare variable operationalization table
5. Plan data analysis approach (descriptive → inferential → interpretation)
