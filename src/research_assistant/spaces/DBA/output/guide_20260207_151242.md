# Guidance: Rewriting Your Research Objective with Chosen Terminology

Grounded in: Prof. Cardasso's Email (Feb 1, 2026) + DBA Research Proposal Template (Section 1) + Prof. Cardasso's Class Notes (01/24/2026) + DRO Thesis Reference

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Understanding the Task

You need to revise your original objective based on Prof. Cardasso's terminology feedback:

Original Objective:
│ "The objective of this research is to investigate how internal IT governance mechanisms - specifically Digital Resource Orchestration and software license rationalization influence capital efficiency and firm performance in enterprises."

The Core Issue: Prof. Cardasso explained that "influence" carries specific methodological implications. You must choose terminology that matches what you can rigorously support with your research design.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Prof. Cardasso's Terminology Hierarchy (Exact Definitions from Email)

| Term | Prof. Cardasso's Definition | Evidentiary Demand | When to Use |
|------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Correlation | "Indicates that two variables vary together. Does not imply directionality or causation." | Lowest | When you can only show variables co-vary |
| Influence | "Suggests that variable X affects variable Y in some way. Direction is implied, but mechanism may remain unspecified, magnitude may vary, and causality may be theoretical rather than empirically proven." | Moderate | When you can show directional effect but not full causality |
| Impact | "Implies a substantial, measurable, and practically meaningful effect of X on Y. Both directional and outcome-oriented, therefore requires higher level of empirical and methodological rigor." | High | When you can prove substantial, measurable causal effect |
| Moderation | "Third variable alters strength or direction of relationship between X and Y. Effect may be weak, conditional, or even absent when certain conditions are not met. Closer to association than to direct causation, operates at multifactor level." | Conditional | When examining how third variable changes relationship strength |

Prof. Cardasso's Specific Recommendation (Direct Quote):
│ "Using 'moderation' for now might particularly suitable option if your findings reveal an association without requiring you to claim direct causality—an assertion that is often more complex and demanding to substantiate at the doctoral level."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Suggested Approach

### Step 1: Match Term to Your Research Design

Review your DRO Thesis Reference methodology and determine which term fits:

Your Planned Methodology (from DRO Thesis Reference):
- **Data Collection**: "Semi-structured interviews with 30-40 senior IT and Finance leaders under anonymity"
- **Theoretical Framework**: Agency Theory + IT Governance literature
- **Research Context**: "Zombie seats" (unused SaaS licenses) and governance mechanisms
- **Approach**: Qualitative-first or mixed-methods

Decision Matrix:

| If Your Research Will... | Choose | Objective Phrasing Example |
|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Show DRO/rationalization and capital efficiency vary together without proving direction | Correlation | "...examine the correlation between IT governance mechanisms and capital efficiency..." |
| Demonstrate that DRO/rationalization affects capital efficiency but not prove full causality | Influence | "...investigate how IT governance mechanisms influence capital efficiency..." |
| Prove substantial, measurable causal effect with high rigor | Impact | "...assess the impact of IT governance mechanisms on capital efficiency..." |
| Show how governance mechanisms alter the strength of waste-performance relationship | Moderation | "...examine how IT governance mechanisms moderate the relationship between SaaS waste and firm performance..." |

### Step 2: Connect to Your DRO Thesis Context

Key Insight from DRO Thesis Reference:
│ "I will adopt the mixed-methods or qualitative-first approach... conducting semi-structured interviews with 30-40 senior IT and Finance leaders under anonymity."

What This Means for Terminology:
- Qualitative interviews reveal associations and patterns, not strict causality
- You're investigating managerial intent behind "zombie seats" (strategic slack vs. waste)
- Agency Theory suggests governance conditions behavior (moderation framework)
- Multiple factors involved (turnover, governance maturity, firm size) = multifactor relationship

Prof. Cardasso's Guidance Applied:
Given your qualitative approach and multifactor context, "moderation" aligns best because:
1. You're examining how governance mechanisms alter the strength of the waste-performance relationship
2. You don't need to claim direct causality (which requires experimental or quasi-experimental design)
3. Your Agency Theory framework supports conditional relationships

### Step 3: Rewrite Using Prof. Cardasso's Structure Requirements

From Class Notes (01/24/2026):
- Start with "The objective of this research is to..." or "The aim of this research is to..."
- Avoid broad topics and terminologies
- Include business context
- Title should use same/similar words as objective
- Structure: General → Specific

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Rewriting Framework

### Option 1: Using "Moderation" (Prof. Cardasso's Suggestion)

Revised Objective:
│ "The objective of this research is to examine how internal IT governance mechanisms—specifically Digital Resource Orchestration and software license rationalization—**moderate the relationship between** SaaS waste and capital efficiency in mid-market technology enterprises."

Why This Works:
- Aligns with qualitative methodology (reveals associations, not strict causality)
- Reflects multifactor reality (governance conditions the waste-performance link)
- Matches Agency Theory framework (governance alters managerial behavior)
- Defensible with interview data (can show conditional relationships)

Business Context Addition (Required by Prof. Cardasso):
│ "In an era where technology firms waste 20-50% of SaaS budgets through 'zombie seats,' understanding how governance mechanisms condition this waste-performance relationship has direct implications for CFOs, investors, and boards seeking operational discipline indicators."

Suggested Title (Using Objective Words):
│ "Moderating Capital Inefficiency: How IT Governance Mechanisms Condition the SaaS Waste-Performance Relationship in Technology Enterprises"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### Option 2: Keeping "Influence" (If You Can Justify It)

Revised Objective:
│ "The objective of this research is to investigate how internal IT governance mechanisms—specifically Digital Resource Orchestration and software license rationalization—**influence** capital efficiency and firm performance in mid-market technology enterprises."

When to Choose This:
- If your methodology includes quantitative components (e.g., financial performance metrics)
- If you can demonstrate directional effect through triangulation (interviews + financial data)
- If you're comfortable claiming "X affects Y" without proving full causality

Justification Needed:
You must explain to Prof. Cardasso why "influence" is defensible given your qualitative-first approach. From his email: "Direction is implied, but mechanism may remain unspecified, magnitude may vary, and causality may be theoretical rather than empirically proven."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


### Option 3: Using "Correlation" (Most Conservative)

Revised Objective:
│ "The objective of this research is to examine the correlation between internal IT governance mechanisms—specifically Digital Resource Orchestration and software license rationalization—**and** capital efficiency in mid-market technology enterprises."

When to Choose This:
- If your methodology is purely exploratory
- If you cannot establish directionality
- If you're only showing variables co-vary

Limitation: This is the weakest claim and may not satisfy doctoral-level contribution expectations.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Validation Against Prof. Cardasso's Criteria

### Checklist for Your Revised Objective

| Criterion (from Class Notes 01/24/2026) | How to Meet It |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| ✓ Starts with "The objective of this research is to..." | Use exact phrasing |
| ✓ Avoids broad topics/terminologies | Be specific: "mid-market technology enterprises," not "enterprises" |
| ✓ Includes business context | Add sentence explaining why this matters to CFOs/investors/boards |
| ✓ Title uses objective words | If objective uses "moderate," title should too |
| ✓ General → Specific structure | Start with broad problem (capital inefficiency), narrow to specific mechanisms (DRO, rationalization) |

### Validation Against DBA Research Proposal Template (Section 1)

From Template: "Your research statement should properly safeguard the scope of your work."

How Terminology Safeguards Scope:
- **"Moderation"** = Scoped to examining conditional relationships (not claiming causality)
- **"Influence"** = Scoped to directional effects (not claiming measurable impact)
- **"Impact"** = Requires proving substantial, measurable effect (highest burden)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Reflection Questions Before Finalizing

1. Methodology Alignment: Can my planned data collection (qualitative interviews) support the term I'm choosing?

2. Theoretical Framework: Does Agency Theory support a moderation framework (governance conditions behavior) or a direct influence framework?

3. Contribution Claim: What am I claiming to contribute? If it's "filling the gap between SAM compliance literature and IT governance strategy literature," does that require proving causality or revealing associations?

4. Defensibility: When Prof. Cardasso asks "Why did you choose this term?" in your proposal defense, what will I say?

5. Literature Review Implications: How will my chosen term shape my research gap framing? (Prof. Cardasso noted this affects lit review even though it's not complete yet)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Next Steps

1. Choose Your Term: Based on your methodology and theoretical framework, select correlation/influence/impact/moderation

2. Rewrite Objective: Use the framework above to craft your revised objective

3. Add Business Context: Include 1-2 sentences explaining why this matters (required by Prof. Cardasso)

4. Draft Title: Ensure title uses same/similar words as objective (Prof. Cardasso's requirement)

5. Validate: Check against Prof. Cardasso's criteria and DBA Proposal Template requirements

6. Prepare Justification: Be ready to explain why your chosen term aligns with your research design

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Critical Reminders

DO:
- Reference Prof. Cardasso's exact definitions when justifying your choice
- Connect terminology to your DRO Thesis methodology (qualitative interviews)
- Follow his structural requirements (start with "The objective...", add business context)
- Consider his "moderation" suggestion seriously (it fits your multifactor context)

DON'T:
- Choose terminology based on what "sounds better"—match it to your methodology
- Ignore the evidentiary demands of each term
- Forget to add business context (Prof. Cardasso requires this)
- Use "impact" unless you can prove substantial, measurable causal effect

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Recommended Choice: Based on your DRO Thesis Reference (qualitative-first approach, Agency Theory framework, multifactor context), "moderation" is the most defensible term. It aligns with Prof. Cardasso's suggestion and matches your methodological capabilities.
