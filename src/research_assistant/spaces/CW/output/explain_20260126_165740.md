## 1. Conceptual Definition

A teaching note is a structured instructional document that serves as the educator's comprehensive guide for case-based pedagogy. As explicitly defined in our course materials, the teaching note is fundamentally "solutions oriented and how to execute those solutions," creating a clear pedagogical distinction from the case study itself, which remains "dilemma focused."

The teaching note transforms business scenarios into systematic learning experiences through our standardized template framework. As emphasized in our methodology: "Only Case Study is for students, Teaching Note is for self (whoever teaches the case)." This document enables instructors to guide classroom discussions strategically toward predetermined learning objectives while preserving the exploratory nature of case methodology.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

The teaching note structure is grounded in established case method pedagogy from our course framework:

Case Method Pedagogy: The structure ensures systematic preparation where "through classroom discussion teacher should guide students in the direction of the teaching note" while maintaining student discovery processes.

Solution-Generation Framework: Our structure supports the core pedagogical principle that "the idea is not to convince everyone about your solution/teach everyone your solution, it is about learning how is a decision arrived at to generate multiple solutions."

Progressive Learning Architecture: The template's staged approach reflects cognitive progression from comprehension to synthesis, ensuring students can evaluate whether "solutions are sustainable."

## 3. Key Components

Based on our Teaching Note Template, the structure comprises nine essential sections organized into three clusters:

### **Foundational Elements (Sections 1-4)**

1. Case Synopsis/Abstract: A 150-200 word summary capturing "what the case is about, central dilemma, and pedagogical focus"

2. Learning Objectives: 3-5 specific outcomes. Our template provides this exact framework:
- "Understand how institutional pressures shape DEI strategy"
- "Evaluate leadership responses to diversity backlash" 
- "Apply decision-making frameworks under reputational pressure"

3. Position in Course: Specification of "suitable course(s) and level (MBA, Executive, Undergraduate)" with topic area identification (OB, Strategy, HRM, Ethics)

4. Relevant Readings: "All sources in APA style" providing theoretical foundation

### **Implementation Framework (Sections 5-7)**

5. Supplementary Materials: Supporting resources "as applicable"

6. Assignment Questions: "All questions listed here" for structured student engagement

7. Teaching Plan: Our template specifies this structured session format:

| Stage | Time (min) | Activity/Discussion Question | Purpose |
|-------|------------|------------------------------|---------|
| Introduction | 10 | What's happening at the company? | Warm-up & comprehension |
| Analysis | 20 | What internal/external pressures shaped the issue? | Identify context |
| Decision | 20 | What are the protagonist's options? | Apply frameworks |
| Conclusion | 15 | What would you recommend? | Synthesize insights |

The template explicitly includes "optional mini-activities (role-play, poll, simulation)" and separate considerations "for online classes."

### **Analytical Framework (Sections 8-9)**

8. Analysis/Suggested Answers: Provides main analytical frameworks including:
- **"SWOT, Stakeholder, or Institutional Theory"**
- **"Tables comparing options (pros/cons)"**
- **"Key teaching takeaways"**

9. What Happened Next: Actual outcomes for learning closure

## 4. Practical Application

Our Tesla Board Governance Case Template demonstrates practical implementation. The case follows our structure with:

- **Executive Summary** providing quick reference for instructors
- **Proposed Title** with alternatives: "Tesla's Board at a Crossroads: Governance in a One-Man Controlled Company (2018–2024)"
- **Organization/Industry Context** detailing market dynamics and governance expectations
- **The Paradox** section highlighting the central dilemma

The template emphasizes evidence-led and balanced presentation - "presenting both Musk's value creation AND the governance concerns, without bias" - demonstrating how teaching notes maintain analytical objectivity while providing instructional guidance.

## 5. Research Considerations

For researchers developing teaching notes, our course materials emphasize several critical considerations:

Data Collection Methodology: "Two ways to collect data: Quantitative, Qualitative" with emphasis on proper citation following "specific publishers (Ivey, Emerald, Sage etc) guideline"

Ethical Framework: Teaching notes must address "Will you be able to collect and use the data ethically?" particularly regarding consent and secondary sources usage.

Relevance Standards: Cases must be "relevant (< 5 yrs)" as "publishers decide what is relevant" and ensure the case "answers the 5 W's (why, what, where, when, whom)"

Publication Readiness: Our framework notes that "when case is reviewed, it is scrutinized" with detailed feedback processes, requiring adherence to "different publishers have different guidelines" before submission.

The teaching note structure thus serves as both pedagogical tool and research framework, ensuring systematic case development that meets academic standards while facilitating effective classroom learning experiences.
