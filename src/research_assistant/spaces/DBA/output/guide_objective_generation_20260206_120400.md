# Guidance: Generating Your Thesis Objective

**Guided by: Prof. Cardasso**  
*Bordeaux Business School | DBA Thesis Proposal Development*

## Understanding What's Being Asked

You need to craft a **thesis objective statement** that will anchor your entire research proposal. This is not just a topic statement—it's a precise declaration of what you intend to discover through your research.

**From Prof. Cardasso's Class Notes (01/24/2026):**
> "You should think on the lines of 'I would like to find out about….' That'll help narrow down on the exact topic."

The objective serves as the foundation for your Research Objectives chapter (Chapter 3 in the DBA Thesis Proposal Template), which then connects to your research questions and methodology.

## Suggested Approach (Without Doing It For You)

### Step 1: Start with Your Discovery Statement
**Prof. Cardasso's exact guidance:**
> "The thesis objective should start with 'The aim of this research is to……/ The objective of this research is to…..'"

Before writing this formal statement, ask yourself:
- **What do I want to find out?** (Use this exact phrasing to clarify your thinking)
- What specific phenomenon am I investigating?
- What relationship or impact am I exploring?

### Step 2: Avoid the Broad Topic Trap
**Prof. Cardasso warns:**
> "Try to avoid broad topics and terminologies"

**Reflection Questions:**
- Is your topic too general? (e.g., "digital transformation" vs. "SaaS rationalization's impact on ROIC")
- Can you narrow it to a specific business context or industry?
- Are you using vague terms that could mean different things?

### Step 3: Provide Business Context
**Prof. Cardasso requires:**
> "There should be some business context for the professors to entertain your objective"

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why does this matter to practitioners (CFOs, boards, managers)?
- What business problem does this address?
- What's the economic or operational significance?

### Step 4: Structure General → Specific
**Prof. Cardasso's framework:**
> "You can make a statement and then go from General to Specific"

Think in layers:
1. **General domain:** What broad field are you in? (e.g., IT governance, capital efficiency)
2. **Specific mechanism:** What particular process or factor? (e.g., SaaS rationalization)
3. **Precise outcome:** What measurable impact? (e.g., effect on ROIC in mid-market tech firms)

### Step 5: Align Your Title with Objective Words
**Prof. Cardasso emphasizes:**
> "You are going to try to use the same words, or similar words, that you are using in the objective."

**Action:** After drafting your objective, circle the key terms. Your title should echo these exact words.

## Relevant KB Materials to Consult

### 1. **Prof. Cardasso Class Notes (01/24/2026)**
- **Section:** "Objective & Research Question"
- **Why it helps:** Contains the exact structural requirements and phrasing rules
- **Key takeaway:** The mandatory opening phrase and the need for business context

### 2. **DBA Thesis Proposal Template - Chapter 3**
- **Section:** "Research Objectives"
- **Why it helps:** Shows how objectives connect to research questions and relevancy
- **Structure to follow:**
  - a) Aims/Objectives of the Project
  - b) Research Questions (hypothesis or problems)
  - c) Relevancy and Implications

### 3. **DRO Thesis Reference (Your Peer Example)**
- **Section:** "Core Research Question"
- **Why it helps:** Demonstrates how to structure a specific, measurable objective
- **Notice:** How it moves from general concept (capital efficiency) → specific mechanism (SaaS rationalization) → precise outcome (ROIC impact)

**Example structure from DRO:**
> "How do internal governance mechanisms—specifically SaaS rationalization and digital resource orchestration—mitigate capital inefficiency, and to what extent does this operational discipline drive superior ROIC in mid-market technology firms?"

## Reflection Questions (Think Through These)

### On Specificity:
1. If someone reads only your objective, can they understand exactly what you're investigating?
2. Have you named the specific variables, mechanisms, or relationships you're studying?
3. Is your scope clear (which industry, firm size, geographic context)?

### On Business Relevance:
4. Can you articulate in one sentence why a CFO or board member should care about your findings?
5. What decision would your research inform?
6. What's the economic or operational consequence of the problem you're addressing?

### On Structure:
7. Does your objective follow the General → Specific flow?
8. Can you break it into: (a) broad domain, (b) specific mechanism, (c) measurable outcome?
9. Does your title use the same key terms as your objective?

### On Positioning:
**Prof. Cardasso asks:**
> "What would be the nice angle that you can say, well, I found out this? Or I have a kind of technology where I can predict this through my study. Because that is also why you can position yourself later on in this market."

10. What unique insight or predictive capability will your research provide?
11. How does this position you as an expert in your field?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Draft your "I would like to find out…" statement** (informal version)
2. **Convert it to formal phrasing:** "The objective of this research is to…"
3. **Check against Prof. Cardasso's criteria:**
   - [ ] Starts with required phrase
   - [ ] Avoids broad topics
   - [ ] Includes business context
   - [ ] Follows General → Specific structure
   - [ ] Title uses objective words

### Before Finalizing:
4. **Review DRO Thesis Reference** for structural inspiration (not content copying)
5. **Map your objective to Chapter 3 structure** in the DBA Thesis Proposal Template
6. **Test with the "30-page rule":** Prof. Cardasso warns that French professors will only read up to the page limit—make your objective compelling from the start

### When Ready:
7. **Connect objective to research questions** (Chapter 3b in template)
8. **Articulate relevancy and implications** (Chapter 3c in template)
9. **Ensure consistency** across Introduction (Chapter 1), Literature Review (Chapter 2), and Research Objectives (Chapter 3)

## Critical Reminders from Prof. Cardasso

**On Page Limits (12/05/2025):**
> "If the limit of the assignment is 30 pages, then that page limit shouldn't exceed; else the French professors would disregard it. They would only read until 30 pages and wouldn't after that."

**On Structure:**
> "Strictly follow the structure provided by the professor"

**On Timeline:**
> "By Nov/Dec we are expected to produce your thesis proposal. It's going to be the main structure of the thesis paper"

## What This Guidance Does NOT Do

This guidance does **not**:
- Write your objective for you
- Choose your research topic
- Define your specific business context
- Determine your research scope

**Why?** Because these decisions must come from **your** expertise, **your** business experience, and **your** research interests. The objective must be authentically yours to sustain you through the entire DBA journey.

## Final Thought

**Prof. Cardasso's positioning question:**
> "What would be the nice angle that you can say, well, I found out this?"

Your objective should make the reader think: "If they discover this, it will matter." That's the test of a strong thesis objective.
