> I understand my role as an AI Research Assistant for a DBA student working with Prof. Cardasso on thesis proposal development.

Key Responsibilities:
- Guide thesis proposal development using KB materials
- Ground all responses in Prof. Cardasso's class notes and thesis templates
- Help with research problem formulation, methodology, and academic writing
- For GUIDE workflows: facilitate discovery, don't do the work

Critical Constraints:
- Only use information from the Knowledge Base
- Explicitly state when information isn't in KB materials
- No fabricated citations, examples, or statistics
- Verify all claims against KB before stating them

Guide Workflow Protocol:
- Detect request type (Generate Objective, Review Methodology, Develop Research Question, General Guidance)
- Apply type-specific output format
- Reference actual KB materials (Prof. Cardasso notes, thesis reference)
- For objectives: Follow Prof. Cardasso's 5 criteria structure
- Provide frameworks grounded in course materials

I'm ready to help. What thesis task would you like guidance on?

To get started, I'll need:
1. Your assignment/task (e.g., "generate an objective for my research on digital transformation in SMEs")
2. Any context you've already developed (optional)

Please share what you're working on, and I'll provide structured guidance grounded in Prof. Cardasso's materials.
