━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1. Conceptual Definition

Sampling methods are systematic procedures for selecting representative units from target populations to enable meaningful quantitative inquiry. According to the course framework, sampling constitutes a fundamental component in the research process sequence: "formulating research questions and hypotheses, measurement and questionnaire design, sampling and sampling design, data analysis and interpretation and communicating research results."

The course emphasizes that proper sampling design is essential for researchers to "apply basic and advanced statistical methods, including computer-based data analysis (SPSS, AMOS, R)" while ensuring findings support valid conclusions through "critical thinking."

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### Research Philosophy Integration

The course materials position sampling within quantitative research philosophies that prioritize systematic inquiry. As stated in the course objectives, sampling must align with "current best practices in quantitative research" to ensure methodological rigor.

### Validity Framework

Two critical validity dimensions directly inform sampling methodology:

Internal Validity: The course defines this as "whether the manipulation of the independent variables or treatments actually caused the observed effects of the dependent variables." Key sampling implications:
- **Survey research**: "Internal Survey is more" - achieves higher internal validity through controlled sampling frames
- **Experimental research**: "Experimental is less" - requires careful randomization to control extraneous variables
- **Control requirement**: "Control of extraneous variables is a necessary condition for establishing internal validity"

External Validity: Defined as "whether the cause and effect relationship found in the experiment can be generalized. To what population, settings, times, independent variables and dependent variables can the results be projected?"
- **Survey research**: "Survey is less" - limited generalizability due to contextual constraints
- **Experimental research**: "Experimental is more" - higher generalizability through randomized sampling

### Deductive Research Alignment

The course advocates for deductive approaches: "For Thesis and Research opt for deductive (preferably). Inductive would be explanatory requiring a lot of time and research to devise a theory on the data being available." This preference shapes sampling toward hypothesis-testing frameworks that "align well with the mental model of cloning a proven theory and validating/testing it."

## 3. Key Components

### Effect Size and Sample Adequacy

The course materials reference Cohen's framework for determining statistical significance and sample requirements:
- **Weak impact**: 0 - 0.2
- **Medium impact**: 0.2 - 0.5
- **High impact**: >0.5

As noted: "When presenting your equation for discussion - you can quote Cohen to demonstrate the significance of the dependent variables." This framework guides power analysis calculations for adequate sample sizes.

### Measurement Scale Considerations

The course emphasizes "The Variate & its measurement scales" as foundational to sampling design. Key principles include:
- **Scale standardization**: "Important to have predictor variables on the same scale"
- **Z-scale normalization**: "Z scale is a good measure to have the variables at the same scale else you'll have a bias equation where one variable will be more"
- **Dispersion measurement**: "Std. Deviation is a better measurability of data dispersion. Not range of the data"

### Construct Validation Through Sampling

The course materials specify: "Look for constructs already available as measures. Identify multiple gaps and then pick one based on the measures." This approach requires:
- Literature-based sampling frames
- **"If a scale exists, use it else create one by conducting experiments (control and experimental groups)"**
- Validation through multiple measurement approaches

## 4. Practical Application

### Research Design Implementation

The course provides specific methodological examples demonstrating sampling applications:

Survey-Based Studies: Exemplified by Prashar & Maity (2024) on "Integrated community-based internal branding" - demonstrates systematic sampling for B2B organizational contexts.

Experimental Designs: Referenced through Belanche et al. (2021) on "Understanding influencer marketing" - shows controlled sampling for causal inference.

Meta-Analytic Approaches: Illustrated by Prashar & Maity (2024) meta-analysis on "Building employee commitment through internal branding" - demonstrates systematic literature sampling protocols.

### Software Integration

The course emphasizes hands-on application through "Installation of SPSS, R, JASP" and "computer-based data analysis (SPSS, AMOS, R)." These tools enable:
- Power analysis for sample size determination
- Randomization procedures
- Post-hoc adequacy testing

### Literature-Based Sampling Strategies

The course provides specific guidance: "Google Scholar - ('Internal Advertising' or 'Internal Branding') and 'Brand Communication' [be specific on what you are looking for and put words in quotes for efficient results]" with systematic filtering by "specific language, region, location."

## 5. Research Considerations

### Methodological Rigor

The course emphasizes: "Very important to cite/quote in a research paper -> that shows data is validated otherwise its a game of assumption." This principle extends to sampling validation through:
- **Literature surveys**: "The best way is to find literature surveys of the paper and related sources of it"
- **Journal quality assessment**: Using ABDC rankings (A*, A, B, C classifications) to ensure sampling from high-quality sources
- **Systematic documentation**: Following established protocols for reproducibility

### Contemporary Research Trends

The course advises analyzing "word cloud (prefer words are on the periphery, not in the center as 3-4 yrs from now, those words wouldn't be relevant anymore)" to ensure sampling captures emerging rather than declining research areas.

### Practical Implementation Timeline

For "Term Paper (~Feb; Quantitative Analysis)", the course recommends systematic progression through sampling design phases, ensuring adequate time for validation and refinement before data collection begins.

### Quality Assurance

The course materials emphasize using established journal databases and "Check out journal papers and what journals are getting approved" to ensure sampling frames meet academic standards and contribute to cumulative knowledge development.
