6- Outline /Work Plan

This chapter of the research proposal gives a concise outline of the work you have carried out so far and of the progress you have made toward the aims of the project. You should concentrate on the parts that contribute specifically to the goals of the proposal, avoiding detailed descriptions of digressions you may have attempted in the earlier, more exploratory, phases of your work. If you have already obtained preliminary results, this is the chapter where you should provide them, in a structured manner that helps supporting the rest of the proposal.

Provide a general monthly/quarterly outline of how you will complete the work within the time scheduled. Not all research proposals lend themselves easily to the creation of detailed work plans.

71: 
72: The Conclusions briefly restate the objectives of your research project, recap the research approach you plan to follow, and clarify in a few words what you expect to find out, why it is scientifically valuable to find it out, and on what basis you expect to evaluate the validity of your results.  Whatever its nature, comprehensive or sketchy, you should be able to put in perspective the implications of the successive steps of your work, reinforcing, in the mind of the reader, the conviction that your approach is solidly oriented toward results, that the topic is timely and relevant, and that the outcomes of the project will contribute significantly to the enhancement of the field.

> Based on my search of the DBA course knowledge base, I need to inform you:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## **CRITICAL FINDING: Research Philosophy Not Covered in Course Materials**

After thoroughly searching the DBA Thesis Proposal Template and Prof. Cardasso's Class Notes, "research philosophy" is not explicitly covered in the provided course materials.

The KB materials contain:
- **Section 5 - Methodology**: Focuses on research methods ("how to" component) but does NOT define research philosophy, epistemology, ontology, or paradigms
- **Prof. Cardasso's Class Notes**: No mention of philosophical foundations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## What I CAN Provide (Grounded in KB):

### **From DBA Thesis Proposal Template - Section 5: Methodology**

│ "Then the next step would be the 'how to' component of the proposal is called the Research Methods, or Methodology, component. It should [provide] a general idea of possible methods you intend to use are adequate for the research at hand."

Key Guidance from Prof. Cardasso:
- Demonstrate you've thought about "how you will do things"
- Show methods are adequate for the research
- Prove project is feasible in the time period available
- Many topics will only have methodology defined during the DBA (not at proposal stage)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## What I CANNOT Provide (Not in KB):

The following are standard doctoral research concepts but are NOT defined in your course materials:

❌ Research philosophy definitions (positivism, interpretivism, pragmatism)  
❌ Epistemological assumptions  
❌ Ontological positions  
❌ Research paradigms  
❌ Philosophical frameworks (critical realism, constructivism, etc.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


## **Recommendation:**

Since "research philosophy" is a foundational concept in doctoral research but is absent from your KB, I suggest:

1. Ask Prof. Cardasso directly if research philosophy should be addressed in Section 5 (Methodology)
2. Check if additional readings on research philosophy will be provided later in the program
3. For your DRO thesis, consider whether your quantitative approach (ROIC analysis) implies a positivist stance—but verify this expectation with your supervisor

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Would you like me to:
- Explain what research philosophy typically means in doctoral research (general knowledge, not KB-grounded)?
- Help you formulate questions to ask Prof. Cardasso about philosophical positioning?
- Focus instead on the methodology guidance that IS in the KB materials?

emphasizing both theoretical rigor and practical application.*

**Next Steps**: Review course materials for deeper exploration and develop your own analytical framework.
